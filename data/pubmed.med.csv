Prefrail and frail persons received home visits from lay volunteers twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the physical training and nutritional intervention group (PTN, n = 35) conducted two sets of six strength exercises and received nutritional support. The social support group (SoSu, n = 23) received visits only. TNF-\xce\xb1, IL-6, CRP, and total leukocyte count were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Changes over time within groups were analyzed with paired t-tests; differences between groups were analyzed with ANCOVA for repeated measurements. In the PTN group, IL-6 and CRP remained stable, whereas in the SoSu group, IL-6 increased significantly from a median value of 2.6 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-10.2) to 3.0 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-20.8), and CRP rose from 0.2 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-0.9) to 0.3 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-3.0) after 12 weeks. In CRP, a significant difference between groups was found. TNF-\xce\xb1 and total leukocyte count did not change in either the PTN group or the SoSu group. Persons showing an increase in physical performance (OR 4.54; 95% CI = 1.33-15.45) were more likely to have constant or decreased IL-6 values than persons who showed no improvement. In conclusion, in non-robust older adults, a physical training and nutritional support program provided by lay volunteers can delay a further increase in some inflammatory parameters.'"

Conservatively treated fingertips can regenerate skin and soft tissues to form a functionally and cosmetically excellent new fingertip. Little is known about this ability that, in humans, is confined to the fingertips. Even less is known about the role of the bacteria that regularly colonize these wounds without negative impact on regeneration and healing.As an alternative to surgery, self-adhesive film dressings are commonly used to establish a wet chamber around the injury. These dressings leak malodorous wound fluid eventually until the wound is dry. Having that into consideration, we have therefore developed a silicone finger cap that forms a mechanically protected, wet chamber around the injury for optimal regeneration conditions. It contains a puncturable reservoir for excess wound fluid, which can be thus routinely analyzed for diagnostic and research purposes.This study protocol explains the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the semiocclusive treatment of fingertip amputations in both children and adults comparing traditional film dressings with the novel silicone finger cap. Being the first RCT using 2 medical devices not yet certified for this indication, it will gather valuable information for the understanding of fingertip regeneration and the design of future definitive studies.'"

However, no studies concerned recovery after discharge except readmission. This study evaluated an ERAS program for pancreaticoduodenectomy from hospital to home.A prospective ERAS cohort undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy was compared with a retrospective control group in terms of postoperative complications and hospital stay, and home recovery after discharge. Propensity-score matching was used to balance their baselines.Two groups of 31 patients with similar propensity scores were established. Postoperative morbidities were 18 of 31 and 26 of 31 in the ERAS and control groups, respectively (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.06). Patients in the ERAS group suffered from fewer cardiovascular complications (3/31 vs 11/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04) and intestinal dysbacteriosis (4/31 vs 13/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04). Median postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the ERAS group (8 vs 16 days; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Although the 2 groups were similar in terms of sleep, defecation, vigor, performance status, and pain control in first month after discharge, patients in the ERAS group enjoyed better food intake recovery (18/31 vs 5/31 in first week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.002; 22/31 vs 9/31 in second week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.008; 23/31 vs 13/31 in fourth week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.01) and fewer weight loss (10/31 vs 19/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.05). Multivariate analyses showed that both improvements were associated with no bowel preparation.ERAS implementation in selected patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy could promise better outcomes, not only in the hospital but also at home in the short term.'"

Forty-eight untrained older (72\xc2\xb16 (\xc2\xb1standard deviation, SD) years men and women were divided into either a team sport group ingesting a drink high in protein (18 g) immediately and 3 h after each training session (TS-HP, n = 13), a team sport group ingesting an isocaloric drink with low protein content (3 g; TS-LP, n = 18), or a control group continuing their normal activities (CON, n = 17).

In this randomized, superiority, multi-center clinical trial, participants were randomized to 12 months of either lifestyle coaching plus care coordination (N = 138), care coordination alone, (N = 142) or treatment as usual (N = 148). There was no effect after 12 months, but we hypothesized that there might have been a delayed treatment effect. Our primary outcome at two-year follow-up was 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease standardized to 60 years of age. After two-years the mean 10-year cardiovascular-disease risk was 8.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6-9.9%) in the CHANGE group, 7.7% (95% CI 6.5-8.9%) in the care coordination group, and 8.9% (95% CI 6.9-9.2%) in the treatment as usual group (P = 0.24). Also, there were no intervention effects for any secondary or exploratory outcomes, including cardiorespiratory fitness, weight, physical activity, diet and smoking. No reported adverse events could be ascribed to the intervention. We conclude that there was neither any direct nor any long-term effect of individual lifestyle coaching or care coordination on cardiovascular risk factors in people with abdominal obesity and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Eighty-nine eyes of 86 patients who underwent silicone oil removal were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into either group A or B. In group A, the fluid-air exchange tube was connected to a 1\xe2\x80\x8amL syringe with the plunger removed and the tip was dilated with a hemostat so that it fit into the cap of the 23-gauge cannula to form a seal for oil drainage. In group B, the tip of the syringe was closely attached to the cap of the 23-gauge cannula by a tube adaptor, which was salvaged from a used silicone oil inject and aspirate pack and sterilized. Main outcome measures were time required for silicone oil removal, silicone oil residual, intraoperative and postoperative complications including hypotony, bleeding, and retinal redetachment.The mean time required was 6.08\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.31\xe2\x80\x8aminutes and 6.11\xe2\x80\x8a\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x8a0.31\xe2\x80\x8aminutes for groups A and B, respectively. No silicone oil residual, severe hypotony, recurrence of retinal detachment, or impairment of visual acuity were observed in either group. Conjunctival injection and hyperemia were slightly more severe in group A, but spontaneously resolved in 2 to 3 days.Both methods described in this paper were demonstrated to be safe, effective, and cost-effective for the ROSO. The syringe dilation method caused more severe conjuntival irritation, thus we suggest using the tube adaptor method for hospitals equipped with cold sterilization equipment.'"

Focal muscle vibration (MV) is instead very useful to reduce segmental spasticity, with a consequent positive effect on motor function. Therefore, it could be possible to strengthen the effects of robotic rehabilitation by coupling MV. To this end, we designed a pilot randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trial NCT03110718) that included twenty patients suffering from unilateral post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Patients underwent 40 daily sessions of Armeo-Power training (1 hour/session, 5 sessions/week, for 8 weeks) with or without spastic antagonist MV. They were randomized into two groups of 10 individuals, which received (group-A) or not (group-B) MV. The intensity of MV, represented by the peak acceleration (a-peak), was calculated by the formula (2\xcf\x80f)2A, where f is the frequency of MV and A is the amplitude. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), short intracortical inhibition (SICI), and Hmax/Mmax ratio (HMR) were the primary outcomes measured before and after (immediately and 4 weeks later) the end of the treatment. In all patients of group-A, we observed a greater reduction of MAS (p = 0.007, d = 0.6) and HMR (p<0.001, d = 0.7), and a more evident increase of SICI (p<0.001, d = 0.7) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment, as compared to group-B. Likewise, group-A showed a greater function outcome of upper limb (Functional Independence Measure p = 0.1, d = 0.7; Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity p = 0.007, d = 0.4) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. A significant correlation was found between the degree of MAS reduction and SICI increase in the agonist spastic muscles (p = 0.004). Our data show that this combined rehabilitative approach could be a promising option in improving upper limb spasticity and motor function. We could hypothesize that the greater rehabilitative outcome improvement may depend on a reshape of corticospinal plasticity induced by a sort of associative plasticity between Armeo-Power and MV.'"

Group A first took digital impressions in a standardized phantom model and then conventional impressions, while the procedures were reversed for Group B. Participants were asked to complete a VAS questionnaire (0-100) on the level of difficulty and applicability (user/patient-friendliness) of both techniques. They were asked which technique they preferred and perceived to be more efficient. A quotient of ""effective scan time per software-recorded time"" (TRIOS) was calculated as an objective quality indicator for intraoral optical scanning (IOS). The majority of students perceived IOS as easier than the conventional technique. Most (72%) preferred the digital approach using IOS to take the implant impression to the conventional method (12%) or had no preference (12%). Although total work was similar for males and females, the TRIOS quotient indicated that male students tended to use their time more efficiently. In this study, dental students with no clinical experience were very capable of acquiring digital tools, indicating that digital impression techniques can be included early in the dental curriculum to help them catch up with ongoing development in computer-assisted technologies used in oral rehabilitation.'"

The study involved a randomized control design and used a convenience sample of all 32 junior-year dental hygiene students enrolled in the autumn 2016 term in The Ohio State University baccalaureate dental hygiene program. Sixteen students were randomly assigned to each of two groups (control and training). At weeks one and four, all participants were photographed and completed ergonomic self-evaluations using the Modified-Dental Operator Posture Assessment Instrument (M-DOPAI). During weeks two and three, participants in the training group were photographed again and used those photographs to complete ergonomic self-assessments. All participants' pre-training and post-training photographs were given ergonomic scores by three raters. Students' self-assessments in the control group and faculty evaluations of the training group showed significant improvement in scores over time (F(1,60)=4.25, p<0.05). In addition, the accuracy of self-assessment significantly improved for students in the training group (F(1,30)=8.29, p<0.01). In this study, dental hygiene students' self-assessments using photographs resulted in improvements in their ergonomic scores and increased accuracy of their ergonomic self-assessments.

This study aimed to explore the effects of collaborative care model (CCM) on patients with CHF. A total of 114 CHF patients were enrolled in this study, and were randomly and equally divided into two groups: control and experimental. Patients in the two groups received either usual care or CCM for 3 continuous months. The impacts of CCM on the self-care ability and quality of life were assessed using self-care of heart failure index and short form health survey 12, respectively. Further, cardiac function was assessed by measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and by the 6-min walking test. Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients in the control and CCM groups were statistically equivalent. Compared with usual care, CCM significantly enhanced self-care abilities of patients with CHF, including self-care maintenance, self-care management and self-care confidence (all P<0.05). The physical and mental quality of life was also significantly improved by CCM (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Compared with usual care, CCM significantly increased the LVEF (P<0.01), decreased the NT-proBNP level (P<0.01), and enhanced exercise capacity (P<0.001).

Maintenance of systemic right ventricular function is crucial for long-term survival, and interventions that improve ventricular function and avoid or defer transplantation in patients with HLHS are urgently needed. We hypothesize that the young myocardium of the HLHS patient is responsive to the biological cues delivered by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to improve and preserve right ventricle function. The ELPIS trial (Allogeneic Human MEsenchymal Stem Cell Injection in Patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome: An Open Label Pilot Study) is a phase I/IIb trial designed to test whether MSC injection will be both safe and feasible by monitoring the first 10 HLHS patients for new major adverse cardiac events. If our toxicity stopping rule is not activated, we will proceed to the phase IIb component of our study where we will test our efficacy hypothesis that MSC injection improves cardiac function compared with surgery alone. Twenty patients will be enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with a uniform allocation to MSC injection versus standard surgical care (no injection).

We have previously shown an association between dietary AGEs and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in a population of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). In the current pilot study we explored the effects of dietary AGEs on the gut bacterial microbiota composition in similar patients. AGEs play an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular (CVD) disease. Plasma concentrations of different bacterial products have been shown to predict the risk of incident major adverse CVD events independently of traditional CVD risk factors, and experimental animal models indicates a possible role AGEs might have on the gut microbiota population. In this pilot randomized open label controlled trial, twenty PD patients habitually consuming a high AGE diet were recruited and randomized into either continuing the same diet (HAGE, n = 10) or a one-month dietary AGE restriction (LAGE, n = 10). Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after intervention. Variable regions V3-V4 of 16s rDNA were sequenced and taxa was identified on the phyla, genus, and species levels. Dietary AGE restriction resulted in a significant decrease in serum N\xce\xb5-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal-derivatives (MG). At baseline, our total cohort exhibited a lower relative abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes genus and a higher abundance of Prevotella genus when compared to the published data of healthy population. Dietary AGE restriction altered the bacterial gut microbiota with a significant reduction in Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium animalis relative abundance and increased Alistipes indistinctus, Clostridium citroniae, Clostridium hathewayi, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii relative abundance. We show in this pilot study significant microbiota differences in peritoneal dialysis patients' population, as well as the effects of dietary AGEs on gut microbiota, which might play a role in the increased cardiovascular events in this population and warrants further studies."""

All neonates underwent neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II at two years of age. Copeptin levels were highest at 6 hours after birth and steadily decreased, whereas the highest NSE levels were measured at 24 hours after birth. The biomarker levels correlated with blood-gas parameters (base excess, pH and lactate) at 6 and 12 hours after birth. Copeptin and NSE levels in the early postnatal period were significantly higher in neonates with poor outcome compared to those with favorable outcome at two years of age. Furthermore, in the TOBY cohort, copeptin levels were significantly lower in hypothermic compared to normothermic neonates.

It remains unclear, however, whether the effects of blue light extend beyond simple alertness processes to also enhance other aspects of cognition, such as memory performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thirty minute pulse of blue light versus placebo (amber light) exposure in healthy normally rested individuals in the morning during verbal memory consolidation (i.e., 1.5 hours after memory acquisition) using an abbreviated version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). At delayed recall, individuals who received blue light (n = 12) during the consolidation period showed significantly better long-delay verbal recall than individuals who received amber light exposure (n = 18), while controlling for the effects of general intelligence, depressive symptoms and habitual wake time. These findings extend previous work demonstrating the effect of blue light on brain activation and alertness to further demonstrate its effectiveness at facilitating better memory consolidation and subsequent retention of verbal material. Although preliminary, these findings point to a potential application of blue wavelength light to optimize memory performance in healthy populations.

A critical knowledge gap exists as to the magnitude of multimorbidity in primary care practice in low and middle income countries with available information limited to prevalence. In India, primary care forms the bulk of the health care delivery being provided through both public (community health center) and private general practice setting. We undertook a study to identify multimorbidity patterns and relate these patterns to severity among primary care attendees in Odisha state of India. A total of 1649 patients attending 40 primary care facilities were interviewed using a structured multimorbidity assessment questionnaire. Multimorbidity patterns (dyad and triad) were identified for 21 chronic conditions, functional limitation was assessed as a proxy measure of severity and the mean severity score for each pattern, was determined after adjusting for age. The leading dyads in younger age group i.e. 18-29 years were acid peptic disease with arthritis/ chronic back ache/tuberculosis /chronic lung disease, while older age groups had more frequent combinations of hypertension + arthritis/ chronic lung disease/vision difficulty, and arthritis + chronic back ache. The triad of acid peptic disease + arthritis + chronic backache was common in men in all age groups. Tuberculosis and lung diseases were associated with significantly higher age-adjusted mean severity score (poorer functional ability). Among men, arthritis, chronic backache, chronic lung disease and vision impairment were observed to have highest severity) whereas women reported higher severity for combinations of hypertension, chronic back ache and arthritis. Given the paucity of studies on multimorbidity patterns in low and middle income countries, future studies should seek to assess the reproducibility of our findings in other populations and settings. Another task is the potential implications of different multimorbidity clusters for designing care protocols, as currently the protocols are disease specific, hardly taking comorbidity into account.'"

A better understanding of how to minimize nocebo responses might eventually contribute to enhanced treatment effects. However, little is known about how to reduce nocebo effects. In the current randomized controlled study, we tested whether nocebo effects can be minimized by positive expectation induction with respect to electrical and histaminic itch stimuli. First, negative expectations about electrical itch stimuli were induced by verbal suggestion and conditioning (part 1: induction of nocebo effect). Second, participants were randomized to either the experimental group or one of the control groups (part 2: reversing nocebo effect). In the experimental group, positive expectations were induced by conditioning with verbal suggestion. In the control groups either the negative expectation induction was continued or an extinction procedure was applied. Afterwards, a histamine application test was conducted. Positive expectation induction resulted in a significantly smaller nocebo effect in comparison with both control groups. Mean change itch NRS scores showed that the nocebo effect was even reversed, indicating a placebo effect. Comparable effects were also found for histamine application. This study is the first to demonstrate that nocebo effects can be minimized and even reversed by conditioning with verbal suggestion. The results of the current study indicate that learning via counterconditioning and verbal suggestion represents a promising strategy for diminishing nocebo responses."""

Moreover, the effects of HPDs according to the source of protein need to be considered in this context.Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the quantity and source of dietary protein on microbiota composition, bacterial metabolite production, and consequences for the large intestinal mucosa in humans.Design: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-design trial was conducted in 38 overweight individuals who received a 3-wk isocaloric supplementation with casein, soy protein, or maltodextrin as a control. Fecal and rectal biopsy-associated microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Fecal, urinary, and plasma metabolomes were assessed by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance. Mucosal transcriptome in rectal biopsies was determined with the use of microarrays.Results: HPDs did not alter the microbiota composition, but induced a shift in bacterial metabolism toward amino acid degradation with different metabolite profiles according to the protein source. Correlation analysis identified new potential bacterial taxa involved in amino acid degradation. Fecal water cytotoxicity was not modified by HPDs, but was associated with a specific microbiota and bacterial metabolite profile. Casein and soy protein HPDs did not induce inflammation, but differentially modified the expression of genes playing key roles in homeostatic processes in rectal mucosa, such as cell cycle or cell death.Conclusions: This human intervention study shows that the quantity and source of dietary proteins act as regulators of gut microbiota metabolite production and host gene expression in the rectal mucosa, raising new questions on the impact of HPDs on the large intestine mucosa homeostasis.

Eleven participants with a diagnosis of T2D randomly underwent three experimental sessions 72 h apart: 1) 20 min of exercise performed at 120% of LT (120%LT), 2) 20 min of exercise performed at 80% of LT (80%LT), and 3) 20 min of control session. Blood glucose was analyzed before, during, and at 45 min post-exercise. Bradykinin and insulin were analyzed before and at 45 min post-exercise. Both exercise sessions elicited a parallel decrease in glucose level during exercise (P\xe2\x89\xa40.002), with a greater decrease being observed for 120%LT (P=0.005). Glucose decreased 22.7 mg/dL (95%CI=10.3 to 35, P=0.001) at the 45 min post-exercise recovery period for 80%LT and decreased 31.2 mg/dL (95%CI=18.1 to 44.4, P<0.001) for 120%LT (P=0.004). Insulin decreased at post-exercise for 80%LT (P=0.001) and control (P\xe2\x89\xa40.035). Bradykinin increased at 45 min post-exercise only for 80%LT (P=0.013), but was unrelated to the decrease in glucose (r=-0.16, P=0.642). In conclusion, exercise performed above and below LT reduced glycemia independently of insulin, but exercise above LT was more effective in individuals with T2D. However, these changes were unrelated to the increase in circulating bradykinin.'"

This study examined the acute effect of breakfast consumption and omission on free-living energy intake (EI) and physical activity (PA) in adolescent girls. Using an acute randomised cross-over design, forty girls (age 13\xc2\xb73 (sd 0\xc2\xb78) years, BMI 21\xc2\xb75 (sd 5\xc2\xb70) kg/m2) completed two, 3-d conditions in a randomised, counter-balanced order: no breakfast (NB) and standardised (approximately 1962 kJ) breakfast (SB). Dietary intakes were assessed using food diaries combined with digital photographic records and PA was measured via accelerometry throughout each condition. Statistical analyses were completed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Post-breakfast EI was 483 (sd 1309) kJ/d higher in NB v. SB (P=0\xc2\xb7025), but total daily EI was 1479 (sd 11311) kJ/d higher in SB v. NB (P<0\xc2\xb70005). Daily carbohydrate, fibre and protein intakes were higher in SB v. NB (P<0\xc2\xb70005), whereas daily fat intake was not different (P=0\xc2\xb7405). Effect sizes met the minimum important difference of \xe2\x89\xa50\xc2\xb720 for all significant effects.

In this sample of adolescent girls, breakfast omission increased post-breakfast free-living EI, but total daily EI was greater when a SB was consumed.

Any loss in muscle power following fatiguing exercise or daily activities could impact physical function and postural control until power has fully recovered. To test the overall hypothesis that a common task such as walking can result in prolonged power loss and decreased physical function and balance, 17 healthy older (66-81 years) women completed a 32-min walking test (32MWT) designed to induce neuromuscular fatigue, followed by 60min of recovery (60R). Fatigue and recovery of knee extensor muscle power (3 velocities) were quantified by dynamometry. Function was quantified by chair rise time and postural control by measures of center of pressure (COP) range (mm) and velocity (mm\xc2\xb7s-1) during quiet stance. Power declined at all velocities by 8-13% 2min following the 32MWT (p\xe2\x89\xa40.02) and remained depressed by 8-26% at 60R (p\xe2\x89\xa40.04). Postural control decreased following the 32MWT, indicated by increased COP range in the anterior-posterior (AP, p<0.01) direction and a trend in the medial-lateral (ML) direction (p = 0.09), and returned to baseline by 60R (p\xe2\x89\xa50.10). COP velocity was unchanged immediately following the 32MWT, but at 60R was lower in ML (p = 0.03) and tended to be reduced in AP (p = 0.07). Changes in high-velocity power (270\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb7s-1) were associated with altered postural control (p = 0.02) and chair rise performance (p\xe2\x89\xa40.03). These results provide evidence of long-duration neuromuscular changes following fatigue in healthy older women that may place them at increased risk for functional deficits during everyday mobility tasks.'"

We conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial in four high volume hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery centres. We evaluated whether the additional impact of a intraoperative fluid optimisation algorithm would influence the amount of fluid delivered, reduce fluid related complications, and improve length of hospital stay. Fifty-two consecutive adult patients were recruited. The median (IQR) duration of surgery was 8.6 hours (7.1:9.6) in the GDT group vs. 7.8 hours (6.8:9.0) in the usual care group (p = 0.2). Intraoperative fluid balance was 1005mL (475:1873) in the GDT group vs. 3300mL (2474:3874) in the usual care group (p<0.0001). Total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively was also lower in the GDT group: 2050mL (1313:2700) vs. 4088mL (3400:4525), p<0.0001 and vasoactive medications were used more frequently. There were no significant differences in proportions of patients experiencing overall complications (p = 0.179); however, fewer complications occurred in the GDT group: 44 vs. 92 (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.41; 95%CI 0.24 to 0.69, p = 0.001). Median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 9.5 days (IQR: 7.0, 14.3) in the GDT vs. 12.5 days in the usual care group (IQR: 9.0, 22.3) for an Incidence Rate Ratio 0.64 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.85, p = 0.002). In conclusion, using a surgery-specific, patient-specific goal directed restrictive fluid therapy algorithm in this cohort of patients, can justify using enough fluid without causing oedema, yet as little fluid as possible without causing hypovolaemia i.e. ""precision"" fluid therapy.

Few studies, however, have reported these relationships under finely controlled sedation. 16 healthy male participants were administrated in intravenous sedation with either propofol or midazolam randomly. We initially determined, using pharmacokinetic simulation, the effect-site concentration (Ce) of anaesthetic at loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex (Ce-LOR). Then subsequently adjusted Ce to 75%, 50%, and 25% of Ce-LOR to achieve deep, moderate, and light sedation. At awake control state and each sedation level, a noxious electrical stimulation was applied three times at the right forearm, an average pain intensity of the three stimuli was rated on a VAS (0-10). Changes in the peripheral perfusion index measured by oximetry were used as an indicator of ANS response. We analyzed the influence of sedation level on VAS and ANS responses compared to the awake control state. While ANS responses were similar in all conditions, VAS was statistically significantly lower in moderate (5.6\xc2\xb10.6, p <0.005) or deep (5.3\xc2\xb10.6, p <0.001) sedation than in the awake state (7.2\xc2\xb10.4).

The WHO recommends 1500-2000 mg Ca/d with iron-folic acid (IFA) taken separately, a complex pill-taking regimen. Objective: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that simpler regimens with lower daily dosages would lead to higher adherence and similar supplement intake.Methods: In the Micronutrient Initiative Calcium Supplementation study, we compared the mean daily supplement intake associated with 2 dosing regimens with the use of a parallel, cluster-randomized noninferiority trial implemented in 16 primary health care facilities in rural Kenya. The standard regimen was 3 \xc3\x97 500 mg Ca/d in 3 pill-taking events, and the low-dose regimen was 2 \xc3\x97 500 mg Ca/d in 2 pill-taking events; both regimens included a 200 IU cholecalciferol and calcium pill and a separate IFA pill. We enrolled 990 pregnant women between 16 and 30 wk of gestation. The primary outcome was supplemental calcium intake measured by pill counts 4 and 8 wk after recruitment. We carried out intention-to-treat analyses with the use of mixed-effect models, with regimen as the fixed effect and health care facilities as a random effect, by using a noninferiority margin of 125 mg Ca/d.Results: Women in facilities assigned to the standard regimen consumed a mean of 1198 mg Ca/d, whereas those assigned to the low-dose regimen consumed 810 mg Ca/d. The difference in intake was 388 mg Ca/d (95% CI = 341, 434 mg Ca/d), exceeding the prespecified margin of 125 mg Ca/d. The overall adherence rate was 80% and did not differ between study arms.Conclusions: Contrary to our expectation, a simpler, lower-dose regimen led to significantly lower supplement intake than the regimen recommended by the WHO. Further studies are needed to precisely characterize the dose-response relation of calcium supplementation and preeclampsia risk and to examine cost effectiveness of lower and simpler regimens in program settings. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02238704.'"

Several previous studies have demonstrated this effect using whole-body resistance exercise. However, it remains unclear whether localized resistance exercise performed using only limited muscle groups could also acutely improve IC. Thus, the present study examined the effect of an acute bout of localized resistance exercise on IC. Twelve healthy men performed a color-word Stroop task (CWST) before and immediately after the experimental conditions, which consisted of 2 resistance exercises and a resting control (CON). Bilateral knee extension was used to create 2 resistance exercise conditions: light-intensity resistance exercise (LRE) and high-intensity resistance exercise (HRE) conditions, which were 40% and 80% of one-repetition maximum, respectively. The resistance exercise session was programmed for 6 sets with 10 repetitions per set. The CWST-measured IC was significantly improved immediately after both LRE and HRE, but it did not improve immediately after CON. However, the improved IC was significantly greater in HRE than in LRE. The present findings showed that IC could be rapidly improved by an acute bout of localized resistance exercise, especially with high-intensity. Therefore, we suggest that in addition to whole-body resistance exercise, localized resistance exercise performed using limited muscle groups may be sufficient for improving IC.'"

Seventeen cyclists underwent active water- and land-based recoveries and passive water and land-based recoveries. The recovery conditions lasted 31 minutes each and started after the identification of each cyclist's blood lactate accumulation peak, induced by a 30-second all-out sprint on a cycle ergometer. Active recoveries were performed on a cycle ergometer at 70% of the oxygen consumption corresponding to the lactate threshold (the control for the intensity was oxygen consumption), while passive recoveries were performed with subjects at rest and seated on the cycle ergometer. Blood lactate concentration was measured 8 times during each recovery condition and lactate clearance was modeled over a negative exponential function using non-linear regression. Actual active recovery intensity was compared to the target intensity (one sample t-test) and passive recovery intensities were compared between environments (paired sample t-tests). Non-linear regression parameters (coefficients of the exponential decay of lactate; predicted resting lactates; predicted delta decreases in lactate) were compared between environments (linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures) separately for the active and passive recovery modes. Active recovery intensities did not differ significantly from the target oxygen consumption, whereas passive recovery resulted in a slightly lower oxygen consumption when performed while immersed in water rather than on land. The exponential decay of blood lactate was not significantly different in water- or land-based recoveries in either active or passive recovery conditions. In conclusion, water immersion at 29\xc2\xb0C would not appear to be an effective practice for improving post-exercise lactate removal in either the active or passive recovery modes."""

We administered stable Fe isotopes as FeFum or NaFeEDTA individually in low-extraction wheat flour bread rolls consumed by all participants in a randomised, cross-over design. In a final, identical meal, consumed only by the women, FeFum+NaFeEDTA was administered. We measured Fe absorption by using erythrocyte incorporation of stable isotopes 14 d after consumption of each meal, and determined Fe status, inflammatory markers and Helicobacter pylori infection. Fe absorption (geometric mean was 9\xc2\xb724 (95 % CI 6\xc2\xb735, 13\xc2\xb744) and 9\xc2\xb726 (95 % CI 7\xc2\xb700, 12\xc2\xb731) from FeFum and 13\xc2\xb706 (95 % CI 9\xc2\xb723, 19\xc2\xb710) and 12\xc2\xb799 (95 % CI 9\xc2\xb718, 18\xc2\xb739) from NaFeEDTA in mothers and children, respectively (P<0\xc2\xb705 between compounds). Fe absorption from FeFum+NaFeEDTA was 11\xc2\xb709 (95 % CI 7\xc2\xb745, 17\xc2\xb734) and did not differ from the other two meals. H. pylori infection did not influence Fe absorption in children. In conclusion, in Haitian women and children, Fe absorption from NaFeEDTA was 40 % higher than from FeFum, and the combination FeFum+NaFeEDTA did not significantly increase Fe absorption compared with FeFum alone. In the context of Haiti, where the high costs of NaFeEDTA may not be affordable, the use of FeFum at 60 mg Fe/kg flour may be a preferable, cost-effective fortification strategy.'"

MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were measured before ablation and at 1, 3, and 6 months' follow-up. Three-day Holter monitoring was performed before ablation, and 6 to 8 weeks and 6 months after ablation. Plasma MR-proANP and NT-proBNP concentrations were higher during AF than during sinus rhythm before ablation (188\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [131;260] vs 94\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [64;125], p\xe2\x80\x89<0.001; 78\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [43;121] vs 10.3\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [5.9;121], p\xe2\x80\x89<0.001) and at 1, 3, and 6 months' follow-up. Categories of AF burden on 3-day Holter monitoring (0%, 0% to 99%, and 99% to 100%) were associated with plasma concentrations of both MR-proANP (94\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [55;127] vs 117\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [88;185] vs 192\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [127;261], p\xe2\x80\x89<0.001) and NT-proBNP (10\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [5.9;22] vs 22\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [8.9;53] vs 81\xe2\x80\x89pmol/L [45;116], p\xe2\x80\x89<0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, however, there was no significant association between baseline propeptide concentrations and recurrence of AF at 6 months' follow-up. In conclusion, AF was associated with higher plasma concentrations of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP than sinus rhythm. Moreover, AF burden was associated with subsequent concentrations of both MR-proANP and NT-proBNP. The results suggest that natriuretic propeptide measurement reflects functional cardiac dysfunction during AF, and that AF burden should be included in biochemical assessment of left ventricular dysfunction."""

In the context of exercise, music may promote behavioral change through increased exercise adherence and participation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a movement-to-music video program could reduce sedentary behavior (SB) and increase PA in mother-child pairs in the home environment. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Pirkanmaa region, Finland, in 2014-2016. The participants consisted of 228 mother-child pairs (child age 5-7 years). The primary outcomes of interest were tri-axial accelerometer-derived SB and PA, which were measured in weeks one (baseline), two, and eight in both the intervention and control groups. Further, the mothers and children in the intervention group used a movement-to-music video program from the beginning of week two to the end of week eight. Secondary outcomes included self-reported screen time. The statistical methods employed comprised an intention-to-treat and linear mixed effects model design. No statistically significant differences between groups were found in primary or secondary outcomes. Among the children in the control group, light PA decreased significantly over time and screen time increased from 89 (standard deviation, SD 37) to 99 (SD 41) min/d. Among mothers and children in the intervention group, no statistical differences were found. In supplementary analysis, the children who stayed at home instead of attending daycare/preschool had on average 25 (95% confidence interval, CI 19-30) min/d more sedentary time and 11 (95% CI 8-14) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous PA than those who were at daycare/preschool. The higher body mass index of mothers was related with 5 (95% CI 2-7) min/d more sedentary time and 1 (95% CI 0-2) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous PA. The movement-to-music video program did not change the objectively measured SB or PA of the mother-child pairs. However, mothers and children seemed to be more sedentary at home, and therefore interventions for decreasing SB and increasing PA should be targeted in the home environment."""

Four of the children (3 boys, 1 girl) were then randomly assigned to receive graded dietary intakes of Met (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1)) with 21 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) Cys. The mean TSAA and minimum Met requirements were determined by measuring the oxidation of l-[1-(13)C]Phe to (13)CO2 (F(13)CO2). A 2-phase linear-regression crossover analysis of the F(13)CO2 data identified a breakpoint at minimal F(13)CO2 Urine samples collected from all study days and from previous studies of healthy children were measured for sulfur metabolites.Results: The mean and population-safe (upper 95% CI) intakes of TSAA and minimum Met in children with CRI were determined to be 12.6 and 15.9 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) and 7.3 and 10.9 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1), respectively. In healthy school-aged children the mean and upper 95% CI intakes of TSAA and minimum Met were determined to be 12.9 and 17.2 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) and 5.8 and 7.3 mg \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1), respectively. A comparison of the minimum Met requirements between healthy children and children with CRI indicated significant (P < 0.05) differences.Conclusion: These results suggest that children with CRI have a similar mean and population-safe TSAA to that of healthy children, suggesting adequate Cys synthesis via transsulfuration, but higher minimum Met requirement, suggesting reduced remethylation rates.'"

However, the effects of long-term treatment of humans with DHA and EPA on various epigenetic factors-such as DNA methylation, which controls messenger RNA generation-are poorly described.Objective: We wanted to determine the effects of 6 mo of dietary supplementation with an n-3 FA preparation rich in DHA on global DNA methylation of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and the relation to plasma EPA and DHA concentrations in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients.Design: In the present study, DNA methylation in four 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites of long interspersed nuclear element-1 repetitive sequences was assessed in a group of 63 patients (30 given the n-3 FA preparation and 33 given placebo) as an estimation of the global DNA methylation in blood cells. Patients originated from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled OmegAD study, in which 174 AD patients received either 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA (the n-3 FA group) or placebo daily for 6 mo.Results: At 6 mo, the n-3 FA group displayed marked increases in DHA and EPA plasma concentrations (2.6- and 3.5-fold), as well as decreased methylation in 2 out of 4 CpG sites (P < 0.05 for all), respectively. This hypomethylation in CpG2 and CpG4 sites showed a reverse correlation to changes in plasma EPA concentration (r = -0.25, P = 0.045; and r = -0.26, P = 0.041, respectively), but not to changes in plasma DHA concentration, and were not related to apolipoprotein E-4 allele frequency.Conclusion: Supplementation with n-3 FA for 6 mo was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in PBLs. Our data may be of importance in measuring various effects of marine oils, including gene expression, in patients with AD and in other patients taking n-3 FA supplements.

Participants within each diet arm received, in random order, diets containing high (150 nmol or 3450 mg), medium (100 nmol or 2300 mg), and low (50 nmol or 1150 mg) amounts of sodium for 30 d (crossover design). Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each sodium intervention. We measured 531 identified plasma metabolites in 73 participants at the end of their high- and low-sodium interventions and in 46 participants at the end of their high- and medium-sodium interventions (N = 119). We used linear mixed-effects regression to model the relation between each log-transformed metabolite and sodium intake. We also combined the resulting P values with Fisher's method to estimate the association between sodium intake and 38 metabolic pathways or groups.Results: Six pathways were associated with sodium intake at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.0013 (e.g., fatty acid, food component or plant, benzoate, \xce\xb3-glutamyl amino acid, methionine, and tryptophan).

Transient rises in PD-1+Foxp3+ Treg and potentially anergic (CD57-KLRG1-PD-1+) cells in the circulating CD4 T cell compartment were paralleled by more profound increases in circulating CD8 T cells with traits of exhaustion (CD57-KLRG1+PD-1+, TIGIT+KLRG1+, and persistent down-modulation of CD127). The observed phenotypic changes across cell types were associated with favorable response to treatment in the subgroup of study participants that did not develop anti-drug antibodies after the first course of therapy.

Consumption of maize that has been biofortified to contain elevated levels of provitamin A carotenoids (orange maize) increased the abundance of (13)C in serum retinol of Mongolian gerbils. We evaluated this method in humans to determine if it has potential for further use in intervention effectiveness studies. A random subset of samples from a two-month randomized controlled feeding trial of rural three- to five-year old Zambian children were used to determine the impact of orange maize intake on serum carotenoid concentrations ( n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8988) and (13)C-natural abundance in serum retinol ( n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8977). Concentrations of \xce\xb2-cryptoxanthin (a xanthophyll provitamin A carotenoid) and the dihydroxy xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin, which do not have vitamin A activity, were elevated in children consuming orange maize compared with those consuming a white maize control ( P\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x890.001), while \xce\xb2-carotene was not different ( P\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x890.3). Furthermore, (13)C natural abundance was higher after two months' intervention in the orange maize group compared with the white maize group ( P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.049). Predictions made from equations developed in the aforementioned gerbil study estimated that maize provided 11% (2-21%, 95% confidence interval) of the recent dietary vitamin A to these children. These results demonstrate that orange maize is efficacious at providing retinol to the vitamin A pool in children through provitamin A carotenoids, as monitored by the change in (13)C enrichment, which was not reflected in serum \xce\xb2-carotene concentrations. Further effectiveness studies in countries who have adopted orange maize should consider determining differences in retinol (13)C-enrichment among target groups in addition to profiling serum xanthophyll carotenoids with specific emphasis on zeaxanthin. Impact statement Maize biofortified with provitamin A carotenoids (orange) has been released in some African markets. Responsive and sensitive methods to evaluate dissemination effectiveness are needed. This study investigated methods to evaluate effectiveness of orange maize consumption using serum from Zambian children fed orange maize for two months. Many varieties of orange maize contain higher amounts of the xanthophyll carotenoids in addition to \xce\xb2-carotene compared with typical varieties. This study uniquely showed higher concentrations of the maize xanthophylls lutein, zeaxanthin, and \xce\xb2-cryptoxanthin in children who consumed orange maize compared with white. Furthermore, maize is a C4 plant and is therefore naturally enriched with (13)C. Higher (13)C was detected in the serum retinol of the orange maize consumers with no change in serum \xce\xb2-carotene concentration suggesting preferential bioconversion to retinol. The combined analyses of serum zeaxanthin specifically and (13)C-natural abundance of retinol could prove useful in effectiveness studies between orange maize adopters and non-adopters."""

Understanding the metabolic mechanisms related to in utero vitamin D exposure may therefore shed light on complex disease susceptibility.Objective: The goal was to analyze the programming role of in utero vitamin D exposure on children's metabolomics profiles.Design: First, unsupervised clustering was done with plasma metabolomics profiles from a case-control subset of 245 children aged 3 y with and without asthma from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), in which pregnant women were randomly assigned to vitamin D supplementation or placebo. Thereafter, we analyzed the influence of maternal pre- and postsupplement vitamin D concentrations on cluster membership. Finally, we used the metabolites driving the clustering of children to identify the dominant metabolic pathways that were influential in each cluster.Results: We identified 3 clusters of children characterized by 1) high concentrations of fatty acids and amines and low maternal postsupplement vitamin D (mean \xc2\xb1 SD; 27.5 \xc2\xb1 11.0 ng/mL), 2) high concentrations of amines, moderate concentrations of fatty acids, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (34.0 \xc2\xb1 14.1 ng/mL), and 3) low concentrations of fatty acids, amines, and normal maternal postsupplement vitamin D (35.2 \xc2\xb1 15.9 ng/mL). Adjusting for sample storage time, maternal age and education, and both child asthma and vitamin D concentration at age 3 y did not modify the association between maternal postsupplement vitamin D and cluster membership (P = 0.0014). Maternal presupplement vitamin D did not influence cluster membership, whereas the combination of pre- and postsupplement concentrations did (P = 0.03).Conclusions: Young children can be clustered into distinct biologically meaningful groups by their metabolomics profiles. The clusters differed in concentrations of inflammatory mediators, and cluster membership was influenced by in utero vitamin D exposure, suggesting a prenatal programming role of vitamin D on the child's metabolome.

Primary study outcomes were individual height-for-age z score (HAZ) and overall child development assessed with the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century Neurodevelopment Assessment tool. Secondary outcomes were weight-for-age z score (WAZ), protein consumption, breastfeeding, and general dietary diversity.Results: We enrolled a total of 547 children with a median age of 13 mo at baseline. Estimated mean difference (\xce\xb2) in HAZ was 0.127 (95% CI: -0.107, 0.361) for HBGM and -0.152 (95% CI: -0.341, 0.036) for CBGM+NS. HBGM had no impact on child development [\xce\xb2: -0.017 (95% CI: -0.133, 0.098)]; CBGM+NS reduced overall child development scores by -0.118 SD (95% CI: -0.230, -0.006 SD). Both interventions had larger positive effects among children with stunted growth at baseline, with estimated interaction effects of 0.503 (95% CI: 0.160, 0.846) and 0.582 (95% CI: 0.134, 1.030) for CBGM+NS and HBGM, respectively.

Both interventions improved parental reports of children's protein intake.Conclusions: The results from this trial suggest that growth monitoring has a limited effect on children's height and development, despite improvements in self-reported feeding practices. HBGM had modest positive effects on children with stunted growth.

We then compared their nutrient intake with that of a similar group of concurrent participants on self-selected habitual diets but abstaining from walnut consumption (control). No recipes or advice on use of nuts were provided. Dietary intake was assessed by multiple unannounced 24-h telephone dietary recalls. On average, walnut supplement consumption was 43 g/d or 1171\xc2\xb75 kJ (281 kcal). The mean daily energy intake was 954 kJ (228 kcal) higher in the walnut group than in the control group (P<0\xc2\xb7001). Compared with control, participants in the walnut group reported significantly higher intake of total protein, vegetable protein, total PUFA and n-3 and n-6 PUFA; and significantly lower intake of total carbohydrate, animal protein, SFA, and Na. An estimated 19 % of total energy and 25 % of total fat from other food sources was displaced. Displacement of MUFA and total PUFA was 21 and 16 %, respectively. Thus adding a daily supplement of walnuts to an ad libitum diet of older adults can induce favourable modifications to the nutrient profile in a way that addresses declining nutrient intake associated with aging.'"

Three experimental diets differing basically in DHA:EPA ratio, that is, 0\xc2\xb768 (diet D:E-0\xc2\xb768), 1\xc2\xb709 (D:E-1\xc2\xb709) and 2\xc2\xb705 (D:E-2\xc2\xb705), were randomly assigned to nine tanks of 3-year-old tongue sole (ten females and fifteen males in each tank). The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0\xc2\xb768, diet D:E-1\xc2\xb709 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2\xc2\xb705 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males.

In testes, diet 2\xc2\xb705 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3\xce\xb2-HSD. Fatty acid profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in liver. In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA:arachidonic acid ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles. Females seemed to require more EPA but less DHA for the gonadal steroidogenesis than males. The results are beneficial to sex-specific nutritive strategies in domestic teleost.'"

Under catabolic conditions characterised by chronic inflammation, the UPS is activated resulting in proteolysis, muscle wasting and impaired muscle function. Milk proteins provide sulphur-containing amino acid and have been proposed to affect muscle inflammation. However, the response of the UPS to aseptic inflammation and protein supplementation is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how milk protein supplementation affects UPS activity and skeletal muscle function under conditions of aseptic injury induced by intense, eccentric exercise. In a double-blind, cross-over, repeated measures design, eleven men received either placebo (PLA) or milk protein concentrate (PRO, 4\xc3\x9720 g on exercise day and 20 g/d for the following 8 days), following an acute bout of eccentric exercise (twenty sets of fifteen eccentric contractions at 30\xc2\xb0/s) on an isokinetic dynamometer. In each trial, muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at baseline, as well as at 2 and 8 d post exercise, whereas blood samples were collected before exercise and at 6 h, 1 d, 2 d and 8 d post exercise. Muscle strength and soreness were assessed before exercise, 6 h post exercise and then daily for 8 consecutive days. PRO preserved chymotrypsin-like activity and attenuated the decrease of strength, facilitating its recovery. PRO also prevented the increase of NF-\xce\xbaB phosphorylation and HSP70 expression throughout recovery. We conclude that milk PRO supplementation following exercise-induced muscle trauma preserves proteasome activity and attenuates strength decline during the pro-inflammatory phase.'"

Patency rates after uncoated balloon angioplasty are disappointing. Although stents have better outcomes, they also have limitations. Intra-arterial stenting may lead to stent thrombosis and flow pattern disruption, which may result in stent fracture or in-stent restenosis. In the past decade, drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) and drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been introduced, and both have been proven to possess antirestenotic features compared with conventional techniques. The objective of this study is to perform a noninferiority analysis of DEBs with provisional bare-metal stenting and primary stenting with DESs in the treatment of femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease. If DEB with provisional bare-metal stenting proves to be noninferior to primary stenting with DESs, DEBs may be the favorable technique because the postoperative long-term limitations of stents will be restricted.

In this secondary analysis of a placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin among 147 HIV+ subjects (median age 46; 78% men) on stable antiretroviral therapy, we aimed to evaluate longitudinal associations between computed tomography (CT) measures of pericardial fat (PCF) volume and density, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We measured PCF volume and density (mean attenuation in Hounsfield units) by noncontrast gated CT at baseline and week 96. Homeostatic model of insulin resistance was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose at entry, 24, 48, and 96 weeks. At baseline, insulin resistance correlated positively with PCF volume and negatively with density. Similarly divergent correlations of volume and density were observed with waist:hip ratio, nadir CD4+ count, and duration of antiretroviral therapy. In a linear mixed model, PCF density was associated with insulin resistance independent of PCF volume, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, and biomarkers of immune activation and systemic inflammation; however, baseline PCF measures were not associated with longitudinal changes in insulin resistance. Soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with PCF volume and was associated with insulin resistance in linear models.

Outcomes included the 400 m walk gait speed, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, and onset of major mobility disability (objectively defined by loss of ability to walk 400 m in 15 min). When the physical activity arm or the entire sample were stratified by change in physical activity from baseline to 24 months, there was a dose-dependent increase in the change in gait speed and SPPB from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months. In addition, the magnitude of change in physical activity over 24 months was related to the reduction in the onset of major mobility disability (overall P < 0.001) (highest versus the lowest quartile of physical activity change HR 0.23 ((95% CI:0.10-0.52) P = 0.001) in the physical activity arm.

The participants received a self-selected keyhole-labelled (Nordic nutrition label) lunch, snack and bottled water during each shift throughout the intervention period. Reaction time (Go/No-Go test), mood-related scores (POMS) and dietary intake were assessed at run-in, and at the end of the intervention and the control periods.

We aimed to develop an RS based on data from patients with acute coronary syndrome in China and to compare its performance with the commonly promoted Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) RS. Clinical Pathways for Acute Coronary Syndromes-Phase 2 was a trial of a quality improvement intervention in China. Patients recruited from 75 hospitals from October 2007 to August 2010 were divided into training and validation sets based on immediate or delayed implementation. A Clinical Pathways for Acute Coronary Syndromes (CPACS) RS for in-hospital mortality was developed separately by gender, using the training set (6,790 patients). Discrimination and calibration of the CPACS RS and GRACE RS were compared on the validation set (3,801 patients). Although discrimination of the GRACE RS was acceptable, this was improved with the CPACS RS (c-statistic 0.82 vs 0.87, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.012 for men; c-statistic 0.78 vs 0.85, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.006 for women). The absolute bias was significantly lower with CPACS RS for both genders (7.6% vs 97.5% in men and 21.5% vs 77.2% in women), compared with the GRACE RS, which systematically overestimated risk. The CPACS RS underestimated risk in women, but only in those already above threshold levels currently used to define a clinical high-risk population. In conclusion, the GRACE RS substantially overestimates the risk of in-hospital death in patients presenting to the hospital with a suspected acute coronary syndrome in China.

However, it is time consuming and inconvenient to measure each segment repeatedly. Moreover, volume of each segment also should be adjusted with arithmetic mean of the selected segments when total amount of liver fat is estimated. Therefore, we try to develop a clinically-relevant and applicable method of estimating hepatic fat in PDFF image.A total of 164 adults were enrolled. We addressed the measurement frequency and segment selection to determine the optimal method of measuring intrahepatic fat. Total hepatic fat was estimated by the weighted mean of each segment reflecting their respective segmental volumes. We designed 2 models. In Model 1, we determined the segment order by which the mean was closest to the whole weighted mean. In Model 2, we determined the segment order by which the arithmetic mean of the selected segments was closest to the whole weighted mean.Fat fraction (FF) was most important risk factor of hepatic heterogeneity in multivariable analysis (\xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.534, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). In severe fatty liver (FF\xe2\x80\x8a>\xe2\x80\x8a22.1%), intrahepatic fat variability was 2.47% (1.16-6.26%). The arithmetic mean total intrahepatic FF was 12.66%. But the weighted mean that applied to each segmental volume was 12.90%. In Model 1, arithmetic mean of segments 4 and 5 was closest to the total estimated hepatic fat amount. However, when we added segment 8, the mean of segments 4, 5, and 8 was significantly different from the estimated total hepatic fat amount (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.0021). In Model 2, arithmetic mean of segments 4 and 5 was closest to the total estimated hepatic fat amount. There was a significant reduction in variability between segment 4 and segments 4 and 5 (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.0001).Averaging the mean hepatic FF of segments 4 and 5 was the most reasonable method for estimating total intrahepatic fat in practice.'"

Research is needed to better define the dose effect and its interindividual variation for carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins.Objective: The objective was to model the dose-response relation between the amount of soybean oil in salad dressing and the absorption of 1) carotenoids, phylloquinone, and tocopherols in salad vegetables and 2) retinyl palmitate formed from the provitamin A carotenoids.Design: Women (n = 12) each consumed 5 vegetable salads with salad dressings containing 0, 2, 4, 8, or 32 g soybean oil. Blood was collected at selected time points. The outcome variables were the chylomicron carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin area under the curve (AUC) and maximum content in the plasma chylomicron fraction (Cmax). The individual-specific and group-average dose-response relations were investigated by fitting linear mixed-effects random coefficient models.Results: Across the entire 0-32-g range, soybean oil was linearly related to the chylomicron AUC and Cmax values for \xce\xb1-carotene, lycopene, phylloquinone, and retinyl palmitate. Across 0-8 g of soybean oil, there was a linear increase in the chylomicron AUC and Cmax values for \xce\xb2-carotene. Across a more limited 0-4-g range of soybean oil, there were minor linear increases in the chylomicron AUC for lutein and \xce\xb1- and total tocopherol. Absorption of all carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins was highest with 32 g oil (P < 0.002). For 32 g oil, the interindividual rank order of the chylomicron AUCs was consistent across the carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Within the linear range, the average absorption of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamins could be largely predicted by the soybean oil effect. However, the effect varied widely, and some individuals showed a negligible response. There was a global soybean oil effect such that those who absorbed more of one carotenoid and fat-soluble vitamin also tended to absorb more of the others.

A shorter chain length and higher saturation of some lipids were directly associated with CVD. After adjusting for multiple testing, direct associations remained significant for 20 lipids, and inverse associations remained significant for 6 lipids. When lipid species were weighted by the number of carbon atoms and double bonds, the strongest inverse association was found for CEs [HR: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.68)] between extreme quintiles (P-trend = 0.002). Participants in the MedDiet + EVOO and MedDiet + nut groups experienced significant (P < 0.05) 1-y changes in 20 and 17 lipids, respectively, compared with the control group. Of these changes, only those in CE(20:3) in the MedDiet + nuts group remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. None of the 1-y changes was significantly associated with CVD risk after correcting for multiple comparisons.Conclusions: Although the MedDiet interventions induced some significant 1-y changes in the lipidome, they were not significantly associated with subsequent CVD risk. Lipid metabolites with a longer acyl chain and higher number of double bonds at baseline were significantly and inversely associated with the risk of CVD.'"

After consuming a run-in diet for 2 wk, participants were randomly assigned to consume a whole grain-rich (WG) or a refined grain-based (RG) diet for 6 wk. Outcomes were measured at weeks 2 and 8.Results: The median total daily excretion of menaquinones in feces was 850 nmol/d but was highly variable (range: 64-5358 nmol/d). The total median (IQR) fecal concentrations of menaquinones decreased in the WG diet compared with the RG diet [-6.8 nmol/g (13.0 nmol/g) dry weight for WG compared with 1.8 nmol/g (12.3 nmol/g) dry weight for RG; P < 0.01)]. However, interindividual variability in fecal menaquinone concentrations partitioned individuals into 2 distinct groups based on interindividual differences in concentrations of different menaquinone forms rather than the diet group or the time point. The relative abundances of several gut bacteria taxa, Bacteroides and Prevotella in particular, differed between these groups, and 42% of identified genera were associated with \xe2\x89\xa51 menaquinone form. Menaquinones were not detected in serum, and neither fecal concentrations of individual menaquinones nor the menaquinone group was associated with any marker of inflammation.Conclusion: Menaquinone concentrations in the human gut appear highly variable and are associated with gut microbiota composition.

Methods In a subgroup of patients from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, we prospectively assessed cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (\xc2\xb1SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21\xc2\xb12.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29\xc2\xb12.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the evolocumab group and -0.93 in the placebo group), episodic memory (change in raw score, -1.53 and -1.53, respectively), or psychomotor speed (change in raw score, 5.2 msec and 0.9 msec, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, there were no associations between LDL cholesterol levels and cognitive changes. Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.

The phase III PROSELICA study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308580) assessed the noninferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m(2) (C20) versus C25 in postdocetaxel patients with mCRPC. Methods Patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, measurability of disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and region, and randomly assigned to receive C20 or C25. To claim noninferiority of C20 (maintenance of \xe2\x89\xa5 50% of the OS benefit of C25 v mitoxantrone in TROPIC) with 95% confidence level, the upper boundary of the CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for C20 versus C25 could not exceed 1.214 under a one-sided 98.89% CI after interim analyses. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor and pain responses and progression, health-related quality of life, and safety. Results Overall, 1,200 patients were randomly assigned (C20, n = 598; C25, n = 602). Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. Median OS was 13.4 months for C20 and 14.5 months for C25 (HR, 1.024). The upper boundary of the HR CI was 1.184 (less than the 1.214 noninferiority margin). Significant differences were observed in favor of C25 for PSA response (C20, 29.5%; C25, 42.9%; nominal P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median: C20, 5.7 months; C25, 6.8 months; HR for C20 v C25, 1.195; 95% CI, 1.025 to 1.393). Health-related quality of life did not differ between cohorts. Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 39.7% for C20 and 54.5% for C25. Conclusion The efficacy of cabazitaxel in postdocetaxel patients with mCRPC was confirmed. The noninferiority end point was met; C20 maintained \xe2\x89\xa5 50% of the OS benefit of C25 versus mitoxantrone in TROPIC. Secondary efficacy end points favored C25.

It is currently banned in the EU because of the high cytotoxicity and carcinogenic activity, which is also shared by leucomalachite green (LMG), a reduced MG metabolite that can persist in fish tissues for months. There is scant information about the ability of either compound to interact with drug metabolizing enzymes in fish. Therefore we evaluated the in vitro effects of MG and LMG (25, 50 and 100\xce\xbcM) on some DMEs and glutathione (GSH) content in rainbow trout liver subfractions. LMG did not affect any of the examined parameters. In contrast, MG proved to deplete GSH and to depress to a various extent the activities of NAD(P)H cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 1-naphthol uridindiphosphoglucuronyl-transferase and maximally those of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) accepting 1-chloro2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate. The inhibition mechanisms of EROD and GST were investigated by means of non-linear Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk plots using 0.175-8\xce\xbcM MG. The calculated IC50 for EROD was 7.1\xce\xbcM, and the inhibition appeared to be competitive (Ki 2.78\xc2\xb10.24\xce\xbcM). In the case of GST, the calculated IC50 was 0.53\xce\xbcM. The inhibition was best described as competitive toward GSH (Ki 0.39\xc2\xb10.02\xce\xbcM) and of mixed-type toward CDNB (Ki 0.64\xc2\xb10.06\xce\xbcM). Our findings indicate that, contrary to LMG, MG behaves as a relatively strong inhibitor of certain liver DMEs and can reversibly bind GSH.'"

Ad libitum EI after 4 h was the primary endpoint. Moreover, appetite sensations and postprandial responses of glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY 3-36, and plasma amino acids were measured.Results: Ad libitum EI did not differ significantly between the meals. Satiety and fullness increased 11% and 13%, respectively, and hunger and prospective intake decreased 17% and 15%, respectively, after the meal of fiber meatballs plus wheat bread compared with the LF meal (P < 0.01). Hormonal and metabolic responses did not differ between the meals. In general, plasma amino acid concentrations were higher after the fiber-rich meals than after the LF meal.Conclusions: Meals based on meatballs and bread with differences in the fiber content, food matrix of fiber, and protein source had similar effects on ad libitum EI in healthy men. However, fiber addition to pork meatballs favorably affected appetite sensations but without changes in hormonal and metabolic responses. Moreover, animal- and vegetable-protein-based, fiber-matched meals had similar effects on appetite regulation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02521805.'"

Expression changes were associated with outcomes after an 8-wk LCD (800-1000 kcal/d) and 6 mo after the LCD. Results were validated by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 350 subjects from the same cohort. Statistical models were constructed to classify weight maintainers or glycemic improvers.Results: With RNAseq analyses, we identified 1173 genes that were differentially expressed after the LCD, of which 350 and 33 were associated with changes in body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) and Matsuda index values, respectively, whereas 29 genes were associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Classification models were constructed to identify weight maintainers. A model based on clinical baseline variables could not achieve any classification (validation AUC: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.64). However, clinical changes during the LCD yielded better performance of the model (AUC: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.87]). Adding baseline expression to this model improved the performance significantly (AUC: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96; Delong's P = 0.012). Similar analyses were performed to classify subjects with good glycemic improvements. Baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded similar performance (best AUC: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.86). The addition of expression changes during the LCD improved the performance substantially (AUC: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.92; P = 0.058).Conclusions: This study investigated AT transcriptome alterations after an LCD in a large cohort of obese, nondiabetic patients. Gene expression combined with clinical variables enabled us to distinguish weight and glycemic responders from nonresponders. These potential biomarkers may help clinicians understand intersubject variability and better predict the success of dietary interventions.

The CVC removal rates were 0.52/1000 CVC days (95% Poisson CLs: 0.17, 1.21/1000 CVC days) and 1.72/1000 CVC days (95% Poisson CLs: 0.89, 3.0/1000 CVC days) in the taurolidine-citrate-heparin and heparin arm, respectively, tending to prolong CVC survival in the taurolidine arm (P = 0.06). Costs per treatment year were lower in the taurolidine arm (\xe2\x82\xac2348) than in the heparin arm (\xe2\x82\xac6744) owing to fewer admission days related to treating CVC-related complications (P = 0.02).Conclusions: In patients with intestinal failure who are life dependent on HPS, the taurolidine-citrate-heparin catheter lock demonstrates a clinically substantial and cost-beneficial reduction of CRBSI occurrence in a high-risk population compared with heparin.

HG has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight. Information about the potential effectiveness of treatments for HG is limited.Objective: We hypothesized that in women with HG, early enteral tube feeding in addition to standard care improves birth weight.Design: We performed a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial [Maternal and Offspring outcomes after Treatment of HyperEmesis by Refeeding (MOTHER)] in 19 hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 116 women hospitalized for HG between 5 and 20 wk of gestation were randomly allocated to enteral tube feeding for \xe2\x89\xa57 d in addition to standard care with intravenous rehydration and antiemetic treatment or to standard care alone. Women were encouraged to continue tube feeding at home. On the basis of our power calculation, a sample size of 120 women was anticipated. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.Results: Between October 2014 and March 2016 we randomly allocated 59 women to enteral tube feeding and 57 women to standard care. The mean \xc2\xb1 SD birth weight was 3160 \xc2\xb1 770 g in the enteral tube feeding group compared with 3200 \xc2\xb1 680 g in the standard care group (mean difference: -40 g, 95% CI: -230, 310 g). Secondary outcomes, including maternal weight gain, duration of hospital stay, readmission rate, nausea and vomiting symptoms, decrease in quality of life, psychological distress, prematurity, and small-for-gestational-age, also were comparable. Of the women allocated to enteral tube feeding, 28 (47%) were treated according to protocol. Enteral tube feeding was discontinued within 7 d of placement in the remaining women, primarily because of its adverse effects (34%).Conclusions: In women with HG, early enteral tube feeding does not improve birth weight or secondary outcomes. Many women discontinued tube feeding because of discomfort, suggesting that it is poorly tolerated as an early routine treatment of HG. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR4197.'"

We aimed to assess the effect of the consumption of the quantity and quality of dietary fat on fasting and postprandial plasma lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A subgroup of 75 subjects with metabolic syndrome was randomized to receive 1 of 4 diets: HSFA, rich in saturated fat; HMUFA, rich in monounsaturated fat; LFHCC n-3, low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; LFHCC low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with placebo, for 12 weeks each. We administered a fat challenge reflecting the fatty acid composition of the diets at postintervention. We determined the plasma lipoproteins and glucose and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and adipose tissue. LPS and LPS binding protein (LBP) plasma levels were determined by ELISA, at fasting and postprandial (4 h after a fat challenge) states. We observed a postprandial increase in LPS levels after the intake of the HSFA meal, whereas we did not find any postprandial changes after the intake of the other three diets. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between the LPS plasma levels and the gene expression of IkBa and MIF1 in PBMC. No statistically significant differences in the LBP plasma levels at fasting or postprandial states were observed. Our results suggest that the consumption of HSFA diet increases the intestinal absorption of LPS which, in turn, increases postprandial endotoxemia levels and the postprandial inflammatory response.'"

The result showed that piglets in HiZ group had less diarrhea than ZNP group (P < 0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference between PC, HiZ and ZNP groups in terms of serum malondialdeyhde (MDA) concentration and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity (P > 0.05). Analysis of trace metal elements revealed that piglets fed with high dose of regular ZnO had the highest Zn level in kidney (P < 0.05), which may induce kidney stone formation. Additionally, a decrease in ileal crypt depth was observed in PC, HiZ and ZNP group, suggesting an effective protection against intestinal injury.

To determine whether acute increase or decrease uric acid levels affects inflammation in healthy individuals, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study of uric acid or rasburicase with 20 healthy volunteers in each treatment-placebo group was conducted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Change in inflammatory response was assessed by administering an oral lipid tolerance before and after the treatment of uric acid, rasburicase and placebo. Following uric acid administration, there was an accentuated increase in IL-6 during the oral lipid tolerance test (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed after lowering of uric acid with rasburicase. No side effects were reported throughout the trial.

However, side effects of statins are very common and may lead to treatment discontinuation. Nutraceuticals are a combination of natural components that have shown efficacy in lowering LDL-C concentration when used alone or in association with other agents in patients who are intolerant to high-dose statins. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose statin (LDS) therapy versus combined therapy of LDS plus a nutraceutical combination containing red yeast rice, policosanol, berberine, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and astaxanthin (Armolipid Plus) in high-risk patients. We performed a randomized (1:1), prospective, parallel group, single-blind trial in which participants had coronary artery disease (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89100), had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention in the preceding 12 months, were high-dose statin intolerant, and did not achieve \xe2\x89\xa550% reduction in LDL-C with LDS treatment alone.

Six patients (3 from each group) dropped out due to myalgia.

Both unipodal and bipodal landings were evaluated. Furthermore, the possibility to improve landing reliability with a verbal instruction was also studied. Twenty-four male volunteers with no history of lower extremity trauma were randomly assigned to two groups (with and without verbal landing instruction). An optoelectronic 3D system and force plates were used to measure the lower limb joint angles and the ground reaction forces during landing.

Since acute hypoglycemia could be a safety concern, blood glucose changes in the above pig study were further investigated. In addition, basal glucose and glucose disposal were investigated in mice. Finally, as part of standard clinical chemistry profiling in a single ascending-dose human safety study, blood glucose levels were evaluated in patients with heart failure after cimaglermin alfa treatment. A single intravenous injection of cimaglermin alfa at doses of 0.8mg/kg and 2.6mg/kg in mice resulted in a transient reduction of blood glucose concentrations of approximately 20% and 34%, respectively, at 2h after the treatment compared to pre-treatment levels. Similar results were observed in diabetic mice. Treatment with cimaglermin alfa also increased blood glucose disposal following oral challenge in mice. However, no significant alterations in blood glucose concentrations were found in human heart failure patients at 0.5 and 2h after treatment with cimaglermin alfa over an equivalent human dose range, based on body surface area. Taken together, these data indicate strong species differences in blood glucose handling after cimaglermin alfa treatment, and particularly do not indicate that this phenomenon should affect human subjects.'"

A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68\xc2\xb79% vs. 52\xc2\xb78%; P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00\xc2\xb7026), whilst a smaller proportion of patients remained above target INR range (12\xc2\xb72% vs. 34\xc2\xb70%; P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00\xc2\xb7001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.'"

The Coordinated Access to Care from Hospital EDs (CATCH-ED) study examined the effectiveness of a brief case management intervention in reducing ED use and improving health outcomes among frequent ED users with mental health or addiction challenges in a large urban centre. Adults (\xe2\x89\xa518 years of age) who had five or more ED visits in the past 12-months, with at least one visit for mental health or addictions problems were randomized to either brief case management (N = 83) or usual care (N = 83) and followed for 12 months.

Secondary outcomes included days in hospital, mental health and addiction symptom severity and health-related quality of life, measured by the SF-12. Compared to usual care, CATCH-ED participants saw a 14% reduction in frequency of ED visits during the 12-month post-randomization period [rate ratio (RR) = 0.86, 95% CI 0.64-1.15)], however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. There were also no statistically significant differences between the groups at 12 months in the number of days spent in hospital (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.59-2.29), physical (1.50, 95% CI -2.15-5.15) or mental (-3.97, 95% CI -8.13-0.19) component scores of the SF-12, severity of psychiatric symptoms (-0.41, 95% CI -2.30-1.49), alcohol (0.053 95% -0.017-0.12) or drug (-0.0027, 95% CI -0.0028-0.023) use.

Changes in HRV due to altered prefrontal cortex functioning can be predicted using the neurovisceral integration model, which suggests that prefrontal hyperactivity increases parasympathetic tone and decreases contributions from the sympathetic nervous system. Working memory (WM) tasks and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been used independently to modulate brain activity demonstrating changes to HRV in agreement with the model. We investigated the combined effects of prefrontal tDCS and a WM task on HRV. Bifrontal tDCS was administered for 15 minutes at 2mA to 20 participants in a sham controlled, single-blind study using parallel groups. A WM task was completed by participants at three time points; pre-, during-, and post-tDCS, with resting state data collected at similar times. Frequency-domain HRV was computed for high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15Hz) power reflecting parasympathetic and sympathetic branch activity, respectively. Response time on the WM task, but not accuracy, improved from baseline to during-tDCS and post-tDCS with sham, but not active, stimulation. HF-HRV was significantly increased in the active tDCS group compared to sham, lasting beyond cessation of stimulation. Additionally, HF-HRV showed a task-related reduction in power during performance on the WM task. Changes in LF-HRV were moderately inversely correlated (r > 0.4) with changes in WM accuracy during and following tDCS compared to baseline levels. Stimulation of the prefrontal cortex resulted in changes to the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system in agreement with a linearly additive interpretation of effects. Sympathetic activity was not directly altered by tDCS, but was correlated with changes in WM performance. This suggests that the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches respond differentially due to similar, but distinct neural pathways. Given the ease of HRV data collection, studies of prefrontal tDCS would benefit from collection of this data as it provides unique insight into tDCS effects resulting from propagation through brain networks.'"

Sixteen male swimmers were randomly divided into a hypoxia (H) group (n = 8), which trained in a normobaric hypoxia environment, and a control (C) group (n = 8), which exercised under normoxic conditions. However, one participant left the study without explanation. During the experiment group H trained on land twice per week in simulated hypoxia (FiO2 = 15.5%, corresponding to 2,500 m a.s.l); however, they conducted swim training in normoxic conditions. Group C performed the same training program under normoxic conditions. The training program included four weekly microcyles, followed by three days of recovery. During practice sessions on land, the swimmers performed 30 second sprints on an arm-ergometer, alternating with two minute high intensity intervals on a lower limb cycle ergometer. The results showed that the training on land caused a significant (p<0.05) increase in absolute maximal workload (WRmax) by 7.4% in group H and by 3.2% in group C and relative values of VO2max by 6.9% in group H and 3.7% in group C. However, absolute values of VO2max were not significantly changed. Additionally, a significant (p<0.05) increase in mean power (Pmean) during the first (11.7%) and second (11.9%) Wingate tests was only observed in group H. The delta values of lactate concentration (\xce\x94LA) after both Wingate tests were significantly (p<0.05) higher in comparison to baseline levels by 28.8% in group H. Opposite changes were observed in delta values of blood pH (\xce\x94pH) after both Wingate tests in group H, with a significant decrease in values of \xce\x94pH by 33.3%. The IHT caused a significant (p<0.05) improvement in 100m and 200m swimming performance, by 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively in group H. Training in normoxia (group C), resulted in a significant (p<0.05) improvement of swimming performance at 100m and 200m, by 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. In conclusion, the most important finding of this study includes a significant improvement in anaerobic capacity and swimming performance after high-intensity IHT. However, this training protocol had no effect on absolute values of VO2max and hematological variables.'"

Like remifentanil, the \xce\xb2-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist may be used to attenuate the stress reaction to tracheal intubation and to modify perioperative anesthetic requirements. It may also reduce the need for opioids in the postoperative period. Its action on the EGJ is however unknown.The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of esmolol and remifentanil on EGJ pressures in healthy volunteers, when administrated as single drugs.'"

We conducted a post hoc analysis of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), a well-characterized cohort of participants randomized to intensive (<120 mm Hg) or standard (<140 mm Hg) systolic BP targets. We defined OBPV as the coefficient of variation of the systolic BP using measurements taken during the 3-,6-, 9-, and 12-month study visits. In our cohort of 7879 participants, older age, female sex, black race, current smoking, chronic kidney disease, and coronary disease were independent determinants of higher OBPV. Use of thiazide-type diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers was associated with lower OBPV whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with higher OBPV. There was no difference in OBPV in participants randomized to standard or intensive treatment groups. We found that OBPV had no significant associations with the composite end point of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (n=324 primary end points; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.69, highest versus lowest quintile) nor with heart failure or stroke. The highest quintile of OBPV (versus lowest) was associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.92; confidence interval, 1.22-3.03) although the association of OBPV overall with all-cause mortality was marginal (P=0.07). Our results suggest that clinicians should continue to focus on office BP control rather than on OBPV unless definitive benefits of reducing OBPV are shown in prospective trials.'"

Patients and Methods Tumor tissue was collected from 1,003 patients with node-negative, stage I and II breast cancer who were randomly assigned in the Swedish Breast Cancer Group 91 Radiotherapy trial between 1991 and 1997 to breast conservation surgery with or without RT. Systemic adjuvant treatment was sparsely used (8%). Subtyping was performed with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays for 958 tumors. Results RT reduced the cumulative incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) as a first event within 10 years for luminal A-like tumors (19% v 9%; P = .001), luminal B-like tumors (24% v 8%; P < .001), and triple-negative tumors (21% v 6%; P = .08), but not for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (luminal and nonluminal) tumors (15% v 19%; P = .6); however, evidence of an overall difference in RT effect between subtypes was weak ( P = .21). RT reduced the rate of death from breast cancer (BCD) for triple-negative tumors (hazard ratio, 0.35; P = .06), but not for other subtypes. Death from any cause was not improved by RT in any subtype. A hypothesized clinical low-risk group did not have a low risk of IBTR without RT, and RT reduced the rate of IBTR as a first event after 10 years (20% v 6%; P = .008), but had no effect on BCD or death from any cause. Conclusion Subtype was not predictive of response to RT, although, in our study, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors seemed to be most radioresistant, whereas triple-negative tumors had the largest effect on BCD. The effect of RT in the presumed low-risk luminal A-like tumors was excellent.'"

Identifying atypical moles is a visual task; thus, SSE training materials utilize pattern-focused visuals to cultivate this skill. Despite widespread use, researchers have yet to explicate how pattern-focused visuals cultivate visual skill. Using eye tracking to capture the visual scanpaths of a sample of laypersons (N\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa092), the current study employed a 2 (pattern: ABCDE vs. ugly duckling sign [UDS]) \xc3\x97 2 (presentation: photorealistic images vs. illustrations) factorial design to assess whether and how pattern-focused visuals can increase layperson accuracy in identifying atypical moles. Overall, illustrations resulted in greater sensitivity, while photos resulted in greater specificity. The UDS \xc3\x97 photorealistic condition showed greatest specificity. For those in the photo condition with high self-efficacy, UDS increased specificity directly. For those in the photo condition with self-efficacy levels at the mean or lower, there was a conditional indirect effect such that these individuals spent a larger amount of their viewing time observing the atypical moles, and time on target was positively related to specificity. Illustrations provided significant gains in specificity for those with low-to-moderate self-efficacy by increasing total fixation time on the atypical moles. Findings suggest that maximizing visual processing efficiency could enhance existing SSE training techniques.'"

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a marker of endothelial dysfunction, has been mechanistically implicated in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, but its impact on coronary physiology early after transplantation is unknown. Invasive indices of coronary physiology, namely, fractional flow reserve (FFR), the index of microcirculatory resistance, and coronary flow reserve, were measured with a coronary pressure wire in the left anterior descending artery within 8 weeks (baseline) and 1 year after transplant. Plasma levels of ADMA were concurrently assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. In 46 heart transplant recipients, there was a statistically significant correlation between elevated ADMA levels and lower FFR values at baseline (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-0.33; p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.024); this modest association persisted 1 year after transplant (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-0.39; p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0085).

Our aim was to provide a standardized metric for physical functioning in adults based on basic and instrumental activities of daily living scaled to NIH PROMIS norms. We provide an item bank to compare the difficulty of various physical functioning activities. We used item response theory methods to place 232 basic and instrumental activities of daily living questions, administered across eight intervention studies of middle-aged and older adults (N = 2,556), on a common metric. We compared the scale's precision to an average z-score of items and evaluated criterion validity based on objective measures of physical functioning and Fried's frailty criteria. Model-estimated item thresholds were widely distributed across the range of physical functioning. From test information plots, the lowest precision in each dataset was 0.80. Using power calculations, the sample size needed to detect 25% physical functional decline with 80% power based on the physical functioning factor was less than half of what would be needed using an average z-score. The physical functioning factor correlated in expected directions with objective measurements from the Timed Up and Go task, tandem balance, gait speed, chair stands, grip strength, and frailty status. Item-level harmonization enables direct comparison of physical functioning measures across existing and potentially future studies and across levels of function using a nationally representative metric. We identified key thresholds of physical functioning items in an item bank to facilitate clinical and epidemiologic decision-making."""

FIRSTANA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308567) assessed whether cabazitaxel 20 mg/m(2) (C20) or 25 mg/m(2) (C25) is superior to docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) (D75) in terms of OS in patients with chemotherapy-na\xc3\xafve mCRPC. Patients and Methods Patients with mCRPC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive C20, C25, or D75 intravenously every 3 weeks plus daily prednisone. The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included safety; progression-free survival (PFS); tumor, prostate-specific antigen, and pain response; pharmacokinetics; and health-related quality of life. Results Between May 2011 and April 2013, 1,168 patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar across cohorts. Median OS was 24.5 months with C20, 25.2 months with C25, and 24.3 months with D75. Hazard ratio for C20 versus D75 was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P = .997), and hazard ratio for C25 versus D75 was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.16; P = .757). Median PFS was 4.4 months with C20, 5.1 months with C25, and 5.3 months with D75, with no significant differences between treatment arms. Radiographic tumor responses were numerically higher for C25 (41.6%) versus D75 (30.9%; nominal P = .037, without multiplicity test adjustment). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 41.2%, 60.1%, and 46.0% for C20, C25, and D75, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and hematuria were more frequent with C25; peripheral neuropathy, peripheral edema, alopecia, and nail disorders were more frequent with D75. Conclusion C20 and C25 did not demonstrate superiority for OS versus D75 in patients with chemotherapy-na\xc3\xafve mCRPC. Tumor response was numerically higher with C25 versus D75; pain PFS was numerically improved with D75 versus C25.

The primary goal was to gain insight into the differences in the recovery patterns of early-crossover patients and those treated nonoperatively; secondary goals were to identify predictors of good 1-year outcomes, and to understand when and why patients were likely to cross over. METHODS Individual EuroQol-5D scores were obtained at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, 38, and 52 weeks for 142 patients. Early-crossover patients were defined as those electing to undergo surgery during the first 12 weeks of treatment. Crossover and noncrossover groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, and chi-square tests. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the growth trajectories of crossover and noncrossover groups. Recursive partitioning trees were used to model crossover events and the timing of crossover decisions. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of good 1-year outcomes. RESULTS Of the 142 patients randomized to receive prolonged nonoperative care, 136 were selected for the study. In this cohort, 43/136 (32%) opted for surgery, and 31/43 (72%) of crossover events occurred before the 12-week time point. Early-crossover patients had significantly greater functional impairment at Week 2 than noncrossover patients (p = 0.031), but experienced greater recovery by 26 weeks and better 1-year outcomes (p = 0.045). Patients who did not experience an improvement in their symptoms between 2 and 8 weeks were more likely to cross over (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.1; p = 0.01). Recursive partitioning trees were able to identify crossover patients with 76% accuracy. Regression models suggested that better recovery at 26 weeks (p < 0.01) was predictive of good 1-year outcome; declining health status between Weeks 4 and 8 was negatively predictive of good outcome (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to comprehensively analyze the recovery and outcomes of crossover patients, and compare them to nonoperatively treated patients. The results suggest that patients who have a low EuroQol-5D score during the early weeks of treatment and who do not respond to nonoperative care during the first few weeks of treatment are most likely to cross over. Early-crossover patients experience a greater rate of recovery and more frequently have a good 1-year outcome when compared with nonoperatively treated patients. The current results motivate a broader investigation into the timing of surgery and the identification of patient populations that will be most benefited by early surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation.'"

A total of 179 lesions among 165 patients, including 100 lesions in LAD, were analyzed. Patients were stratified into tertiles. In pre-percutaneous coronary intervention analysis of whole coronary tree and LAD, lesions of the third tertile had the highest prevalence of lipid-rich plaque. Compared with the first tertile, the third tertile had greater lipid index, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma. In poststent optical coherence tomography, the incidence of stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion was higher in the third tertile compared with the first tertile in coronary tree analysis. In LAD analysis, the prevalence of irregular protrusion was the highest in the third tertile. In conclusion, high SS may reflect higher plaque vulnerability.

A total of 42 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: placebo, nocebo, and control. They received 96 electrical stimuli, preceded by either orange or blue lights. A hidden conditioning procedure, in which participants were not informed about the meaning of coloured lights, was performed in the placebo and nocebo groups. Light of one colour was paired with pain stimuli of moderate intensity (control stimuli), and light of the other colour was paired with either nonpainful stimuli (in the placebo group) or painful stimuli of high intensity (in the nocebo group). In the control group, both colour lights were followed by control stimuli of moderate intensity without any conditioning procedure. Participants rated pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity, and fear. In the testing phase, when both of the coloured lights were followed by identical moderate pain stimuli, we found a significant analgesic effect in the placebo group, and a significant hyperalgesic effect in the nocebo group. Neither expectancy nor fear ratings predicted placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia. It appears that a hidden conditioning procedure, without any explicit verbal suggestions, elicits placebo and nocebo effects, however we found no evidence that these effects are predicted by either expectancy or fear. These results suggest that classical conditioning may be a distinct mechanism for placebo and nocebo effects.'"

Given the challenge of blinding most water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, diarrheal disease outcome measures in WASH intervention trials are subject to potential bias and misclassification. Using the platform of a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a household-based drinking water filter in western province, Rwanda, we assessed the impact of the drinking water filter on enteric seroconversion in young children as a health outcome and examined the association between serologic responses and caregiver-reported diarrhea. Among the 2,179 children enrolled in the trial, 189 children 6-12 months of age were enrolled in a nested serology study. These children had their blood drawn at baseline and 6-12 months after the intervention was distributed. Multiplex serologic assays for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica, norovirus, Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae were performed. Despite imperfect uptake, receipt of the water filter was associated with a significant decrease in seroprevalence of IgG directed against Cryptosporidium parvum Cp17 and Cp23 (relative risk [RR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.89). Serologic responses were positively associated with reported diarrhea in the previous 7 days for both Giardia intestinalis (RR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.04-3.63) and C. parvum (RR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). Serologic responses for all antigens generally increased in the follow-up round, rising sharply after 12 months of age. The water filter is associated with reduced serologic responses against C. parvum, a proxy for exposure and infection; therefore, serologic responses against protozoa may be a suitable health outcome measure for WASH trials among children with diarrhea.'"

Information about the effects of protein on energy intake and related gastrointestinal mechanisms and whether these differ between men and women is limited.Objective: We determined the effects of whey protein on energy intake, appetite, gastric emptying, and gut hormones in healthy older men and women.Design: Eight older women and 8 older men [mean \xc2\xb1 SEM age: 72 \xc2\xb1 1 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 25 \xc2\xb1 1] were studied on 3 occasions in which they received protein loads of 30 g (120 kcal) or 70 g (280 kcal) or a flavored water control drink (0 kcal). At regular intervals over 180 min, appetite (visual analog scales), gastric emptying (3-dimensional ultrasonography), and blood glucose and plasma gut-hormone concentrations [insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY)] were measured, and ad libitum energy intake was quantified from a buffet meal (180-210 min; energy intake, appetite, and gastric emptying in the men have been published previously).Results: Energy intake at the buffet meal was \xe2\x88\xbc80% higher in older men than in older women (P < 0.001). Energy intake was not suppressed by protein compared with the control in men or women (P > 0.05). There was no effect of sex on gastric emptying, appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, glucose, or gut hormones (P > 0.05). There was a protein load-dependent slowing of gastric emptying, an increase in concentrations of insulin, glucagon, cholecystokinin, GIP, GLP-1, and PYY, and an increase in total energy intake (drink plus meal: 12% increase with 30 g and 32% increase with 70 g; P < 0.001). Energy intake at the buffet meal was inversely related to the stomach volume and area under the curve of hormone concentrations (P < 0.05).Conclusion: In older men and women, whey-protein drinks load-dependently slow gastric emptying and alter gut hormone secretion compared with a control but have no suppressive effect on subsequent ad libitum energy intake.

Participants were recruited from the osteoarthritis outpatient clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital in Frederiksberg, Denmark; they had previously completed a 68-wk lifestyle intervention trial and achieved an average weight loss of 10.5 kg (10% of initial body weight). Participants were randomly assigned to either the intermittent treatment (IN) group with LED for 5 wk every 4 mo for 3 y or to daily meal replacements of 1-2 meals for 3 y [regular (RE) group].

The study was conducted within the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions Trial in Matlab (MINIMat study), Bangladesh. A total of 4436 pregnant women were enrolled in the study when they were at less than 14 gestational weeks. The expected CRL was determined based on an established growth curve of gestational age and CRL, and deviation from this curve of CRL was expressed as a z-score. After identifying related covariates, the multiple Poisson regression model was used to determine the independent contribution from the CRL to miscarriage. A total of 3058 singleton pregnant women were included in analyses, with 92 miscarriages and 2966 continued pregnancies. The occurrence of miscarriages was significantly higher in the smaller categories of CRL z-score after adjustments for maternal age, parity, early pregnancy BMI, gestational age at CRL measurement and socioeconomic status (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval]: 1.03 [1.02-1.05] for less than -2 z-score). In a rural Bangladesh population, smaller than expected CRL for the gestational age was related to subsequent miscarriage.

The importance of elevated HR across serial assessment is uncertain, particularly with well-applied guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with beta blockers (BBs).

Some suggest that this is because easy-to-discriminate events help learners focus attention on discrimination-relevant dimensions. Here, we tested whether such attentional-spotlighting accounts are sufficient to explain easy-to-hard effects in auditory perceptual learning. In two experiments, participants were trained to discriminate periodic, frequency-modulated (FM) tones in two separate frequency ranges (300-600 Hz or 3000-6000 Hz). In one frequency range, sounds gradually increased in similarity as training progressed. In the other, stimulus similarity was constant throughout training. After training, participants showed better performance in their progressively trained frequency range, even though the discrimination-relevant dimension across ranges was the same. Learning theories that posit experience-dependent changes in stimulus representations and/or the strengthening of associations with differential responses, predict the observed specificity of easy-to-hard effects, whereas attentional-spotlighting theories do not. Calibrating the difficulty and temporal sequencing of training experiences to support more incremental representation-based learning can enhance the effectiveness of practice beyond any benefits gained from explicitly highlighting relevant dimensions.'"

It is, however, unclear how stress disrupts the relative contribution of the two systems controlling reward-seeking behavior, i.e. model-free (or habit) and model-based (or goal-directed). Here, we investigated whether stress biases the contribution of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning processes differently depending on the valence of outcome, and whether stress alters the learning rate, i.e., how quickly information from the new environment is incorporated into choices. Participants were randomly assigned to either a stress or a control condition, and performed a two-stage Markov decision-making task in which the reward probabilities underwent periodic reversals without notice. We found that stress increased the contribution of model-free reinforcement learning only after negative outcome. Furthermore, stress decreased the learning rate. The results suggest that stress diminishes one's ability to make adaptive choices in multiple aspects of reinforcement learning. This finding has implications for understanding how stress facilitates maladaptive habits, such as addictive behavior, and other dysfunctional behaviors associated with stress in clinical and educational contexts."""

Simulation results show that our method was able to classify subjects according to their patterns of treatment response with greater than 80% accuracy in the three scenarios tested. We then applied our model to a large randomized controlled phase III clinical trial of multiple myeloma patients. Analysis results suggest that the longitudinal tumor burden trajectories in multiple myeloma patients are heterogeneous and nonlinear, even among patients assigned to the same treatment cohort. In addition, between cohorts, there are distinct differences in terms of the regression parameters and the distributions among categories in the mixture.

To test effects of marketing strategies on consumers and suppliers, we randomized 1,798 households in rural Haiti and collected data on purchases of a household chlorination product for 4 months. Households received randomly selected prices ($0.11-$0.56 per chlorine bottle), and half received monthly visits from sales agents. Each $0.22 drop in price increased purchases by 0.10 bottles per household per month (P < 0.001). At the mean price, each 1% drop in price increased purchases by 0.45% (elasticity = 0.45). There is suggestive evidence that household visits by some sales agents increased purchases at mid-range prices; however, the additional revenue did not offset visit cost. Choosing the lowest price and conducting visits maximizes chlorine purchase, whereas slightly raising the retail price and not conducting visits maximizes cost recovery. For the equivalent cost, price discounts increase purchases 4.2 times as much as adding visits at the current retail price. In this context, price subsidies may be a more cost-effective use of resources than household visits, though all marketing strategies tested offer cost-effective ways to achieve incremental health impact. Decisions about pricing and promotion for health products in developing countries affect health impact, cost recovery, and cost-effectiveness, and tradeoffs between these goals should be made explicit in program design.'"

In this study, we compared the performance of skeleton-binding protein 1 (SBP1), ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen, Hyp8, ring-exported protein 1 (REX1), and PHISTb mRNA for detecting ring-stage trophozoite-specific transcripts using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Markers were tested on tightly synchronized in vitro parasites and clinical trial samples alongside established markers of parasite density (18S DNA and rRNA) and gametocyte density (Pfs25 mRNA). SBP1 was the most sensitive marker but showed low-level expression in mature gametocytes. Novel markers REX1 and PHISTb showed lower sensitivity but higher specificity for ring-stage trophozoites. Using in vivo clinical trial samples from gametocyte-negative patients, we observed evidence of persisting trophozoite transcripts for at least 14 days postinitiation of treatment. It is currently not clear if these transcripts represent viable parasites that may have implications for clinical treatment outcome or transmission potential.'"

This novel intervention targeted five behaviors; cleanliness of serving utensils, handwashing with soap before feeding, proper storage of cooked food, and thorough reheating and water treatment. Based on formative research and a creative process using the Behavior-Centered Design approach, an innovative intervention package was designed and delivered over a period of 3 months. The intervention activities included local rallies, games, rewards, storytelling, drama, competitions linking with emotional drivers of behavior, and ""kitchen makeovers"" to disrupt behavior settings. The effect of the package on behavior was evaluated via a cluster-randomized before-after study in four villages with four villages serving as controls. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean cluster level proportions of mothers directly observed practicing all five food hygiene behaviors. The five targeted food hygiene behaviors were rare at baseline (composite performance of all five behaviors in intervention 1% [standard deviation (SD) = 2%] and in control groups 2% [SD = 2%]). Six weeks after the intervention, the target behaviors were more common in the intervention than in the control group (43% [SD = 14%] versus 2% [SD = 2%], P = 0.02) during follow-up. The intervention appeared to be equally effective in improving all five behaviors in all intervention clusters. This study shows that a theory-driven, systematic approach employing emotional motivators and modifying behavior settings was capable of substantially improving multiple food hygiene behaviors in Nepal.'"

To examine risk factors for V. cholerae infections and investigate intervention strategies among this population, we followed household contacts of cholera patients for the 1-week high-risk period after the index patient obtained care. This study was nested within a randomized controlled trial of the Cholera-Hospital-Based-Intervention-for-7-days (CHoBI7), a handwashing with soap and water treatment intervention in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rectal swab results were available from 320 household contacts of cholera patients at five time points over a 1-week period. Fecal and water samples were analyzed for V. cholerae by bacterial culture. All analyses were stratified by study arm. Within the intervention arm, stored household drinking water with a median free chlorine concentration below 0.5 mg/L was associated with a three times higher odds of a cholera infection (odds ratio [OR]: 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32, 6.63). In the control arm, having V. cholerae in stored water was associated with a significantly higher odds of a symptomatic cholera infection (OR: 8.66; 95% CI: 2.11, 35.48). No association was found between observed handwashing with soap at food and stool-related events and V. cholerae infections. Stored household drinking water with detectable V. cholerae and chlorine concentrations below the World Health Organization guideline were found to be important risk factors for cholera infection among household contacts of cholera patients. These findings emphasize the need for water treatment interventions targeting this high risk population.'"

A total of 3,612 serum samples collected at three time points from children 1-5 years of age were tested for antibody responses to two schistosome antigens (soluble egg antigen [SEA] and Sm25) by multiplex bead assay. The overall prevalence of antibody responses to SEA was high at baseline (50.0%). After one round of mass drug administration (MDA), there was minimal change in odds of SEA positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02, confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-1.32, P = 0.89). However, after two rounds of treatment, there was a slight decrease in odds of SEA positivity (OR = 0.80, CI = 0.63-1.02, P = 0.08). In contrast to the SEA results, prevalence of antibody responses to Sm25 was lowest at baseline (14.1%) and higher in years 2 (19.8%) and 3 (18.4%). After one round of MDA, odds of Sm25 positivity increased significantly (OR = 1.51, CI = 1.14-2.02, P = 0.005) and remained significantly higher than baseline after two rounds of MDA (OR = 1.37, CI = 1.07-1.76, P = 0.01).

To evaluate platelet function changes during OPCAB due to preoperative aspirin use, we conducted a randomized controlled trial using flow cytometry and the Multiplate\xc2\xae analyzer. Forty-eight patients scheduled for elective OPCAB were randomized to the aspirin continuation (100 mg/day until operative day) and discontinuation (4 days before the operative day) groups. Platelet function was measured using the platelet activation markers CD62P, CD63, and PAC-1 by flow cytometry, and platelet aggregation was measured using the Multiplate\xc2\xae analyzer, after the induction of anesthesia (baseline), at the end of the operation, and 24 and 48 h postoperatively. Findings of conventional coagulation assays, thromboelastography by ROTEM\xc2\xae assays, and postoperative bleeding-related clinical outcomes were compared between groups. No significant change in CD62P, CD63, or PAC-1 was observed at the end of the operation or 24 or 48 h postoperatively compared with baseline in either group.

However, only 62 participants completed the study. The participants were randomized into a verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. Both the groups received treatment once a week for 12 weeks. The Cohen's global measure of perceived stress scale (PSS-14) was completed by each participant prior to treatment, at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment completion. While participants of both the groups showed a substantial initial decrease in perceived stress scores, at 12 weeks post treatment, the verum acupuncture group showed a significantly greater treatment effect than the sham acupuncture group.

Participants read either correcting information refuting a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism or a control passage about bird feeding. Additionally, participants either completed a self-affirmation exercise where they reflected on their personal values or in a control condition in which they reflected on least-personally-important values that might be important to others. Participants exposed to the correcting information were less likely to believe that vaccines cause serious side effects, but no less likely to believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism. For parents with initially positive vaccine attitudes, there was no effect of condition on intent to vaccinate a future child. For parents with initially negative vaccine attitudes, self-affirmation was ineffective in the presence of correcting information and resulted in less intention to vaccinate in the absence of correcting information.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can be used to evaluate intravascular volume by calculating the ratio of extracellular water (ECW) to intracellular water (ICW). There have been no reports examining the mechanisms of tolvaptan-induced diuresis using BIA. We investigated whether tolvaptan decreases excess volume while maintaining intravascular volume in ADHF patients.Study patients included 29 ADHF patients (age 48-95, men 69%) diagnosed between April 2013 and May 2016 and who underwent BIA before and after treatment. Fifteen patients were treated with tolvaptan in addition to conventional diuresis therapy (tolvaptan group), and 14 patients were treated with conventional diuresis therapy only (control group).

However, there are few interventional studies in human patients with atherosclerogenic diseases. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) reflects arterial stiffness and is a clinical surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol on arterial stiffness assessed by CAVI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 50 patients with T2DM received supplement of a 100mg resveratrol tablet (total resveratrol: oligo-stilbene 27.97 mg/100 mg/day) or placebo daily for 12 weeks. CAVI was assessed at baseline and the end of study. Body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), glucose and lipid metabolic parameters, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs; an oxidative stress marker) were also measured.Resveratrol supplementation decreased systolic BP (-5.5 \xc2\xb1 13.0 mmHg), d-ROMs (-25.6 \xc2\xb1 41.8 U.CARR), and CAVI (-0.4 \xc2\xb1 0.7) significantly (P < 0.05) and decreased BW (-0.8 \xc2\xb1 2.1 kg, P = 0.083) and body mass index (-0.5 \xc2\xb1 0.8 kg/m(2), P = 0.092) slightly compared to baseline, while there were no significant changes in the placebo group. Decreases in CAVI and d-ROMs were significantly greater in the resveratrol group than in the placebo group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified resveratrol supplementation as an independent predictor for a CAVI decrease of more than 0.5.In conclusion, 12-week resveratrol supplementation may improve arterial stiffness and reduce oxidative stress in patients with T2DM. Resveratrol may be beneficial in preventing the development of atherosclerosis induced by diabetes. However, a large-scale cohort study is required to validate the present findings.'"

Evidence is limited, with support from naso-ileal lipid infusion studies.Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate whether glucose infused into the duodenum and ileum differentially alters appetite response, food intake, and secretion of satiety-related gastrointestinal peptides.Design: Fourteen healthy male participants were randomly assigned to a blinded 4-treatment crossover, with each treatment of single-day duration. On the day before the intervention (day 0), a 380-cm multilumen tube (1.75-mm diameter) with independent port access to the duodenum and ileum was inserted, and position was confirmed by X-ray. Subsequently (days 1-4), a standardized breakfast meal was followed midmorning by a 90-min infusion of isotonic glucose (15 g, 235 kJ) or saline to the duodenum or ileum. Appetite ratings were assessed with the use of visual analog scales (VASs), blood samples collected, and ad libitum energy intake (EI) measured at lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner.Results: Thirteen participants completed the 4 infusion days. There was a significant effect of nutrient infused and site (treatment \xc3\x97 time, P < 0.05) such that glucose-to-ileum altered VAS-rated fullness, satisfaction, and thoughts of food compared with saline-to-ileum (Tukey's post hoc, P < 0.05); decreased ad libitum EI at lunch compared with glucose-to-duodenum [-22%, -988 \xc2\xb1 379 kJ (mean \xc2\xb1 SEM), Tukey's post hoc, P < 0.05]; and increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) compared with all other treatments (Tukey's post hoc, P < 0.05).Conclusions: Macronutrient delivery to the proximal and distal small intestine elicits different outcomes.

Adolescents with borderline developmental personality disorder (bpd) have an essential deficit in their personality structure that leads to oscillations in their self-esteem and in a ""split"" perception of the world. They suffer from a variety of symptoms and severe impairments on their own and their families\' quality of life. Their fragmented perception of themselves and others make relationships almost unbearable for them. Relationships are mostly marked by severe anxiety of resentment and rejection. For these patients this causes intolerable trouble at school where every day conflicts take place. Self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts often seem the only way out. By now, there is an agreement that an early specialized assessment and treatment is necessary in order to stop the typical consequences of their self-mutilative and dysfunctional behavior. Still, in contrast to adult age, empirical evidence is missing which proves the effectiveness of treating adolescent borderline patients. In this paper we present a research project on the effectiveness of transference focused psychotherapy with adolescent borderline patients (TFP-A) in a day clinic setting, combining TFP with group skills training as known from dialectic behavior therapy (DBT). Furthermore, we give first results on analyzing the effectiveness of our day clinic treatment program based on TFP-A, focusing on improving core symptoms such as affective problems, aggressive behavior against self and others and interpersonal problems.'"

Here we studied further the 'sweet water taste' (SWT) perceived after exposure to the sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Experiment 1 investigated an incidental observation that presenting lactisole in mixture with sucrose reduced the intensity of the SWT. The results confirmed this observation and also showed that rinsing with sucrose after lactisole could completely eliminate the SWT. The generalizability of these findings was investigated in experiment 2 by presenting 5 additional sweeteners before, during, or after exposure to lactisole. The results found with sucrose were replicated with fructose and cyclamate, but the 3 other sweeteners were less effective suppressors of the SWT, and the 2 sweeteners having the highest potency initially enhanced it. A third experiment investigated these interactions on the tongue tip and found that the lactisole SWT was perceived only when water was actively flowed across the tongue. The same experiment yielded evidence against the possibility that suppression of the SWT following exposure to sweeteners is an aftereffect of receptor activation while providing additional support for a role of sweetener potency. Collectively these results provide new evidence that complex inhibitory and excitatory interactions occur between lactisole and agonists of the sweet taste receptor TAS1R2-TAS1R3. Receptor mechanisms that may be responsible for these interactions are discussed in the context of the current model of the SWT and the possible contribution of allosteric modulation."""

Thus, screening for the exogenous use of these prohibited substances can be established by monitoring a range of endogenous steroids, which constitute the steroid profile and evaluate their concentrations and ratios against reference values. The steroid profiling is currently based on population statistics. As large interindividual variations exist, athlete biological passport (ABP) analysis is ongoing. This study aimed to identify new biomarker(s) for aromatase inhibitor detection in sports using statistical analysis and adapt the model into ABP analysis.Forty-one Chinese nonathlete volunteers (21 males and 20 females) were administered 3 nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (aminoglutethimide, letrozole, and anastrozole) independently. Statistical analysis was performed on 16 steroid profile parameters.After administration, the concentrations of endogenous androgen biomarkers including testosterone (T), epitestosterone, androsterone (AN), etiocholanolone (ETIO), 5\xce\xb1-diol, 5\xce\xb2-diol, and dehydroepiandrosterone were increased, while the level of estrogen was decreased. These biomarkers returned to the baselines levels within 1 month. In females, the concentrations of endogenous biomarkers were affected by nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, without a common trend. Three new endogenous biomarkers (AN/estrone, ETIO/estrone, and T/estrone) elevated significantly after treatment. The 3 new models were more sensitive than the World Anti-Doping Agency ratio biomarkers. They were also effective in exponentially weighted moving average chart analysis.Verification experiment demonstrated that the biomarker T/estrone was valid in judging the steroidal aromatase inhibitor abuse. The screening of these new endogenous biomarkers can provide additional parameters to support ABP monitoring and specific information regarding the administered steroids.'"

The diagnostic value of plasma NGAL obtained at ICU admission and intraoperative diuresis was determined with respect to patients already meeting AKI criteria 6\xe2\x80\x8ahours after surgery (AKI6h) and to all patients meeting AKI criteria at least once during the postoperative course (AKItotal). AKI was diagnosed by the definition of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) group creatinine criteria and was screened up to postoperative day 3. Receiver operating characteristic curves including a gray zone approach were performed.A total of 48 patients were analyzed. None of the patients had increased creatinine levels before surgery and 14 patients (29.2%) developed AKI after surgery. Plasma NGAL was predictive for AKI6h (AUCAKI6h 0.832 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.629-0.976), P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.001) and AKItotal (AUCAKItotal 0.710 (CI 0.511-0.878), P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.023). The gray zones of pNGAL calculated for AKI6h and AKItotal were 210 to 245 and 207 to 274 ng mL, respectively. The lower cutoffs of the gray zone at 207 and 210 ng mL had a negative predictive value (NPV) (i.e., no AKI during the postoperative course) of 96.8% (CI 90-100) and 87.1% (CI 78-97), respectively. Intraoperative diuresis was also predictive for AKI6h (AUCAKI6h 0.742 (CI 0.581-0.871), P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.019) with a gray zone of 0.5 to 2.0 mL kg h. At the lower cutoff of the gray zone at 0.5 mL kg h, corresponding to the oliguric threshold, the NPV was 84.2% (78-92).This study indicates that pNGAL can be used as an early marker to rule out AKI occurring within 3 days after major abdominal surgery.

There are few comparative studies of 28-mm MoM articulations with conventional metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) couplings. We present a long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial comparing MoM versus MoP 28-mm articulations, focused on metal ions and implant survival. Patients and methods - 85 patients with a mean age of 65 years at surgery were randomized to a MoM (Metasul) or a MoP (Protasul) bearing. After 16 years, 38 patients had died and 4 had undergone revision surgery. 13 patients were unavailable for clinical follow-up, leaving 30 patients (n = 14 MoM and n = 16 MoP) for analysis of metal ion concentrations and clinical outcome. Results - 15-year implant survival was similar in both groups (MoM 96% [95% CI 88-100] versus MoP 97% [95% CI 91-100]). The mean serum cobalt concentration was 4-fold higher in the MoM (1.5\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcg/L) compared with the MoP cohort (0.4\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcg/L, p < 0.001) and the mean chromium concentration was double in the MoM (2.2\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcg/L) compared with the MoP cohort (1.0\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcg/L, p = 0.05). Mean creatinine levels were similar in both groups (MoM 93\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcmol/L versus MoP 92\xe2\x80\x89\xce\xbcmol/L). Harris hip scores differed only marginally between the MoM and MoP cohorts. Interpretation - This is the longest follow-up of a randomized trial on 28-mm MoM articulations, and although implant survival in the 2 groups was similar, metal ion concentrations remained elevated in the MoM cohort even in the long term.'"

Each condition consisted of three days within a randomised crossover trial design. Sleep information was collected using a commercial wireless bedside sleep monitor. Measures of skin temperature were evaluated using iButton skin thermistors to establish both distal and proximal skin temperatures and distal to proximal gradient.

We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of echocardiographic hypo-responders and clinical hypo-responders to CRT-D with LBBB in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. Five-hundred thirty-four patients with LBBB in the CRT-D arm were followed for 5.6 years (median). Clinical hypo-response was defined as HF event in the first year after CRT-D implantation.

Echocardiographic and clinical response was observed in 257 patients (48%). Two-hundred fifty patients (47%) were echocardiographic hypo-responders and 27 patients (5%) were clinical hypo-responders. Echocardiographic hypo-responders had increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with echocardiographic\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89clinical responders (hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37 to 5.94, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005).

In conclusion, during long-term follow-up, patients with mild HF and LBBB who have echocardiographic hypo-response to CRT, with or without clinical signs of worsening HF, have increased risk of mortality.

We conducted a prospective trial in patients with MM aimed at comparing MRI and PET-CT with respect to the detection of bone lesions at diagnosis and the prognostic value of the techniques. Patients and Methods One hundred thirty-four patients received a combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) with or without autologous stem-cell transplantation, followed by lenalidomide maintenance. PET-CT and MRI were performed at diagnosis, after three cycles of RVD, and before maintenance therapy. The primary end point was the detection of bone lesions at diagnosis by MRI versus PET-CT. Secondary end points included the prognostic impact of MRI and PET-CT regarding progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results At diagnosis, MRI results were positive in 127 of 134 patients (95%), and PET-CT results were positive in 122 of 134 patients (91%; P = .33). Normalization of MRI after three cycles of RVD and before maintenance was not predictive of PFS or OS. PET-CT became normal after three cycles of RVD in 32% of the patients with a positive evaluation at baseline, and PFS was improved in this group (30-month PFS, 78.7% v 56.8%, respectively). PET-CT normalization before maintenance was described in 62% of the patients who were positive at baseline. This was associated with better PFS and OS. Extramedullary disease at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, whereas PET-CT normalization before maintenance was an independent prognostic factor for PFS. Conclusion There is no difference in the detection of bone lesions at diagnosis when comparing PET-CT and MRI. PET-CT is a powerful tool to evaluate the prognosis of de novo myeloma.'"

This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial, delivered in communities of Australia in overweight women with PCOS, compared the effectiveness and safety of a lifestyle intervention plus herbal medicine against lifestyle alone. All participants were helped to construct a personalized lifestyle plan. The herbal intervention consisted of two tablets. Tablet 1 contained Cinnamomum verum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hypericum perforatum and Paeonia lactiflora. Tablet 2 contained Tribulus terrestris. The primary outcome was oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea. Secondary outcomes were hormones; anthropometry; quality of life; depression, anxiety and stress; pregnancy; birth outcomes; and safety. One hundred and twenty-two women gave their consent. At 3\xc2\xa0months, women in the combination group recorded a reduction in oligomenorrhoea of 32.9% (95% confidence interval 23.3-42.6, p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01) compared with controls, estimated as a large effect (\xce\xb7p(2) \xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.11).

The effectsat 6-month and 12-month survival rates were compared between the two groups. The results demonstrated that the overall effective rate and clinical benefit rate of the observation group were much higher than those of the control group (30.3% vs 11.9%; 79.8%; vs 44.3%) (P less than 0.05). The serum Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP) and Carcino Embryonie Antigen (CEA) levels of the observation group were much lower than those of the control group; the Karnofsky performance score of the observation group was much lower than that of the control group; the two differences had statistical significance (P less than 0.05). The 6-month survival rate of the observation group was 91.67%, higher than that of the control group (86.11%) (P>0.05). The 12-month survival rate of the observation group was 83.33%, much higher than that of the control group (61.11%) (P less than 0.05). The difference of the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups had no statistical significance (P>0.05).

A substudy was conducted in 2 sites to collect blood samples perioperatively to measure prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1+2, thrombin generation), plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PAP, fibrinolysis), platelet factor 4 (PF4 platelet activation), and fibrinogen. Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the substudy (37 placebo vs 44 in treatment group). No difference in clinical outcome was detected, including postoperative bleeding and need for blood products transfusion. All patients showed changes of all plasma biomarkers with greater values than baseline in both groups. This reaction was attenuated significantly in the treatment group for PF1.2 (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.040) and PAP (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.042) values at the first intraoperative measurement. No difference between groups was detected for PF4. Methylprednisolone treatment attenuates activation of coagulation system in high-risk patients undergoing CPB surgery.

The West German Study Group trial, ADAPT (Adjuvant Dynamic Marker-Adjusted Personalized Therapy Trial Optimizing Risk Assessment and Therapy Response Prediction in Early Breast Cancer) compares pathologic complete response (pCR) rates of T-DM1 versus trastuzumab with ET in early HER2-positive/HR-positive breast cancer. Patients and Methods In this prospective, neoadjuvant, phase II trial, 375 patients with early breast cancer with HER2-positive and HR-positive status (n = 463 screened) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of T-DM1 with or without ET or to trastuzumab with ET. The primary end point was pCR (ypT0/is/ypN0). Early response was assessed in 3-week post-therapeutic core biopsies (proliferation decrease \xe2\x89\xa5 30% Ki-67 or cellularity response). Secondary end points included safety and predictive impact of early response on pCR. Adjuvant therapy followed national standards. Results Baseline characteristics were well balanced among the arms. More than 90% of patients completed the therapy per protocol. pCR was observed in 41.0% of patients treated with T-DM1, 41.5% of patients treated with T-DM1 and ET, and 15.1% with trastuzumab and ET ( P < .001). Early responders (67% of patients with assessable response) achieved pCR in 35.7% compared with 19.8% in nonresponders (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.19). T-DM1 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of grade 1 to 2 toxicities, especially thrombocytopenia, nausea, and elevation of liver enzymes. Overall toxicity was low; seventeen therapy-related severe adverse events (T-DM1 arms v trastuzumab plus ET; 5.3% v 3.1%, respectively) were reported. Conclusion The ADAPT HER2-positive/HR-positive trial demonstrates that neoadjuvant T-DM1 (with or without ET) given for only 12 weeks results in a clinically meaningful pCR rate. Thus, a substantial number of patients are spared the adverse effects of systemic chemotherapy.'"

Sixteen of these participants also completed 6 wk of SIT, each session followed immediately by their designated recovery condition. Four muscle biopsies were obtained in total, three during the single SIT session (preexercise, postrecovery, and 3 h postrecovery) and one 48 h after the last SIT session.

However, regular CWI had no effect on changes in these markers, consistent with the lack of response in the markers of mitochondrial biogenesis.

We examined the acute effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg, n = 9) and the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan (50 mg, n = 10) on hemodynamics as well as total body and cardiac norepinephrine spillover in patients with chronic HFrEF. Hemodynamic and neurochemical measurements were made at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 h after oral dosing.

The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment. Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean \xc2\xb1 SD: -3.7 \xc2\xb1 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 \xc2\xb1 13.5; P = 0.011). At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 \xc2\xb1 14.5) and the habitual-fiber (-8.4 \xc2\xb1 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-fiber groups only.Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake. Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.'"

Participants in the Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet (OPUS) Supermarket intervention (SHOPUS) trial consumed ad libitum for 26 wk the New Nordic Diet, which is high in fiber and whole grains, or a control diet. Participants in the NUGENOB (Nutrient-Gene Interactions in Human Obesity) trial consumed a hypocaloric low-fat and high-carbohydrate or a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet for 10 wk. On the basis of FPG before treatment, participants were categorized as normoglycemic (FPG <5.6 mmol/L), prediabetic (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L), or diabetic (FPG \xe2\x89\xa57.0 mmol/L). Modifications of the dietary effects of FPG and FI before treatment were examined with linear mixed models.Results: In the DiOGenes trial, prediabetic individuals regained a mean of 5.83 kg (95% CI: 3.34, 8.32 kg; P < 0.001) more on the high- than on the low-glycemic load diet, whereas normoglycemic individuals regained a mean of 1.44 kg (95% CI: 0.48, 2.41 kg; P = 0.003) more [mean group difference: 4.39 kg (95% CI: 1.76, 7.02 kg); P = 0.001]. In SHOPUS, prediabetic individuals lost a mean of 6.04 kg (95% CI: 4.05, 8.02 kg; P < 0.001) more on the New Nordic Diet than on the control diet, whereas normoglycemic individuals lost a mean of 2.20 kg (95% CI: 1.21, 3.18 kg; P < 0.001) more [mean group difference: 3.84 kg (95% CI: 1.62, 6.06 kg); P = 0.001]. In NUGENOB, diabetic individuals lost a mean of 2.04 kg (95% CI: -0.20, 4.28 kg; P = 0.07) more on the high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet than on the low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet, whereas normoglycemic individuals lost a mean of 0.43 kg (95% CI: 0.03, 0.83 kg; P = 0.03) more on the low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet [mean group difference: 2.47 kg (95% CI: 0.20, 4.75 kg); P = 0.03]. The addition of FI strengthened these associations.Conclusion: Elevated FPG before treatment indicates success with dietary weight loss and maintenance among overweight patients consuming diets with a low glycemic load or with large amounts of fiber and whole grains.

All volunteers were examined by a calibrated examiner for the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (Turesky modification) and L\xc3\xb6e-Silness Gingival Index (GI). Gingival severity was also measured by the percentage of sites with positive gingival bleeding. During six weeks, oral hygiene consisted of brushing twice daily with a toothbrush and toothpaste and rising with their assigned mouthwash. Plaque and gingival parameters were assessed at baseline, after four and six weeks of product use. Statistical analyses were performed separately for plaque and gingival indices, by ANOVA, paired t-test and ANCOVA (\xce\xb1 < 0.05). After 4 and 6 weeks, all mouthwashes groups presented statistically significant reductions in plaque and gingival parameters as compared to baseline.

The intervention consisted of six counseling sessions on healthy feeding during the child's first year of life, the first of which held at the maternity ward and the others at 7, 15, 30, 60, and 120 days, at the homes. Information on the infant's diet was obtained monthly during the first 6 months and then every 2 months until the child reached 12 months of age, using a Food Frequency Questionnaire, in addition to questions on mealtimes, consistency of the foods, hygiene, preparation of meals, conservation of foods, and the mother's or grandmother's approach to the child's diet in the presence of illness. The outcome was defined as meeting the Ten Steps to a Healthy Diet: A Food Guide for Children Under Two Years Old, assessed by a score.

Early studies in focal dystonias have pointed to segregated changes in brain activity and connectivity. Only recently has the notion that dystonia pathophysiology may lie in abnormalities of large-scale brain networks appeared in the literature. Here, we outline a novel concept of functional connectome-wide alterations that are linked to dystonia phenotype and genotype. Using a neural community detection strategy and graph theoretical analysis of functional MRI data in human patients with the laryngeal form of dystonia (LD) and healthy controls (both males and females), we identified an abnormally widespread hub formation in LD, which particularly affected the primary sensorimotor and parietal cortices and thalamus. Left thalamic regions formed a delineated functional community that highlighted differences in network topology between LD patients with and without family history of dystonia. Conversely, marked differences in the topological organization of parietal regions were found between phenotypically different forms of LD. The interface between sporadic genotype and adductor phenotype of LD yielded four functional communities that were primarily governed by intramodular hub regions. Conversely, the interface between familial genotype and abductor phenotype was associated with numerous long-range hub nodes and an abnormal integration of left thalamus and basal ganglia. Our findings provide the first comprehensive atlas of functional topology across different phenotypes and genotypes of focal dystonia. As such, this study constitutes an important step toward defining dystonia as a large-scale network disorder, understanding its causative pathophysiology, and identifying disorder-specific markers.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The architecture of the functional connectome in focal dystonia was analyzed in a large population of patients with laryngeal dystonia. Breaking with the empirical concept of dystonia as a basal ganglia disorder, we discovered large-scale alterations of neural communities that are significantly influenced by the disorder's clinical phenotype and genotype."""

As diet is a significant moderator of systemic inflammation, the dietary inflammatory index (DIITM) has recently been devised to assess the overall inflammatory potential of an individual's diet. The primary objective of this study was to assess the association of the DII with common carotid artery-intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) and carotid plaques. To substantiate the clinical importance of these findings we assessed the relationship of DII score with atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD)-related mortality, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (CVA)-related mortality and ischaemic heart disease (IHD)-related mortality more. The study was conducted in Western Australian women aged over 70 years (n 1304). Dietary data derived from a validated FFQ (completed at baseline) were used to calculate a DII score for each individual. In multivariable-adjusted models, DII scores were associated with sub-clinical atherosclerosis: a 1 sd (2\xc2\xb713 units) higher DII score was associated with a 0\xc2\xb7013-mm higher mean CCA-IMT (P=0\xc2\xb7016) and a 0\xc2\xb7016-mm higher maximum CCA-IMT (P=0\xc2\xb7008), measured at 36 months. No relationship was seen between DII score and carotid plaque severity. There were 269 deaths during follow-up.

We compared three types of continuous abdominal wall block for analgesia after midline laparotomy for gynaecological oncology surgery. We conducted a single-centre, double-blind randomised controlled trial.

All groups received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, and regular paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Measured outcomes included analgesic and antiemetic usage and visual analog scores for pain, nausea, vomiting, and satisfaction. Eighty-eight patients were analysed (29 SC, 29 PRS and 30 TAP). No differences in the primary outcome were found (median milligrams morphine usage on day two SC 28, PRS 25, TAP 21, P=0.371). There were differences in secondary outcomes.

This study examined the impact of different methotrexate (MTX) and corticosteroid treatment strategies on neurocognitive functioning in children with high-risk B-lineage ALL. Methods Participants were randomly assigned to receive high-dose MTX with leucovorin rescue or escalating dose MTX with PEG asparaginase without leucovorin rescue. Patients were also randomly assigned to corticosteroid therapy that included either dexamethasone or prednisone. A neurocognitive evaluation of intellectual functioning (IQ), working memory, and processing speed (PS) was conducted 8 to 24 months after treatment completion (n = 192). Results The method of MTX delivery and corticosteroid assignment were unrelated to differences in neurocognitive outcomes after controlling for ethnicity, race, age, gender, insurance status, and time off treatment; however, survivors who were age < 10 years at diagnosis (n = 89) had significantly lower estimated IQ ( P < .001) and PS scores ( P = .02) compared with participants age \xe2\x89\xa5 10 years. In addition, participants who were covered by US public health insurance had estimated IQs that were significantly lower ( P < .001) than those with US private or military insurance. Conclusion Children with high-risk B-lineage ALL who were age < 10 years at diagnosis are at risk for deficits in IQ and PS in the absence of cranial radiation, regardless of MTX delivery or corticosteroid type. These data may serve as a basis for developing screening protocols to identify children who are at high risk for deficits so that early intervention can be initiated to mitigate the impact of therapy on neurocognitive outcomes.'"

We explored the predictive utility of hyponatremia at the time of hospital discharge among HF patients with normal admission sodium (Na). Characteristics and outcomes of HF patients enrolled in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness trial, who had normal Na on admission, were compared between those who were hyponatremic (Na <135 meq/L) or normonatremic on discharge. Three hundred six patients with normal admission Na had either hyponatremia (n\xc2\xa0= 86) or normal Na (n\xc2\xa0= 220) on discharge. Compared with patients with normal Na on discharge, hyponatremic patients were younger (p\xc2\xa0= 0.004), with lower discharge systolic (p <0.001) and diastolic (p\xc2\xa0= 0.004) blood pressure, higher discharge blood urea nitrogen (p\xc2\xa0= 0.011) despite similar creatinine (p\xc2\xa0= 0.566), lower ejection fraction (p\xc2\xa0= 0.007), and higher left ventricular end-diastolic (p\xc2\xa0= 0.028) and end-systolic (p\xc2\xa0= 0.007) dimensions. Despite comparable congestion on hospital admission, patients with discharge hyponatremia had a higher degree of decongestion throughout hospitalization evident in the significantly greater admission to discharge weight loss (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.044) and admission to discharge reduction in inferior vena cava diameter (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.014). Despite longer initial hospitalization (p\xc2\xa0= 0.004), total duration in hospital at 30 days (p\xc2\xa0= 0.004) and 6 months (p\xc2\xa0= 0.045), there were no significant differences between patients with discharge hyponatremia versus normal Na on discharge regarding rehospitalization (p\xc2\xa0= 0.386), all-cause mortality (p\xc2\xa0= 0.440), and composite of death, cardiac rehospitalization, and cardiac transplant (p\xc2\xa0= 0.799), all up to 6-month following randomization. Restricted cubic spline analysis also showed no significant relationships between discharge Na and the aforementioned 3 outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regressions showed that discharge hyponatremia did not significantly predict any of the 3 outcomes after adjustment for imbalances at baseline. Among patients with discharge hyponatremia, a poor outcome was more likely if they were also hyponatremic on admission: the composite end point occurred in 69.2% of those also hyponatremic on admission versus 51.2% of those with normal Na on admission but decreased Na on discharge (p\xc2\xa0= 0.045). Because the median discharge Na level in the discharge hyponatremia group was 132 meq/L, our findings suggest a benign nature of mild discharge hyponatremia in HF patients with normal admission Na.'"

Eight lean subjects were studied by measuring arteriovenous concentrations of metabolites and ATBF on three different occasions during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps with concomitant infusions of GIP, GIP(3-30)NH2, or both GIP and GIP(3-30)NH2 During infusion of GIP(3-30)NH2 alone and in combination with GIP, insulin levels and the total glucose amount infused to maintain the clamp were lower than during GIP alone.

Adipose tissue triacylglyceride (TAG) and glucose uptake decreased, and the free fatty acid/glycerol ratio increased during the antagonist alone and in combination with GIP.

Robust tools to estimate drug levels in human brain are therefore key for a successful discovery program. Animal models constitute an appropriate choice for drugs without species differences in receptor pharmacology or pharmacokinetics. Translation to man becomes more challenging when interspecies differences are prominent. This report describes the discovery of the dual orexin receptor 1 and 2 (OX1 and OX2) antagonist ACT-541468 out of a class of structurally related compounds, by use of physiology-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PBPK-PD) modeling applied early in drug discovery. Although all drug candidates exhibited similar target receptor potencies and efficacy in a rat sleep model, they exhibited large interspecies differences in key factors determining their pharmacokinetic profile. Human PK models were built on the basis of in vitro metabolism and physicochemical data and were then used to predict the time course of OX2 receptor occupancy in brain. An active ACT-541468 dose of 25 mg was estimated on the basis of OX2 receptor occupancy thresholds of about 65% derived from clinical data for two other orexin antagonists, almorexant and suvorexant. Modeling predictions for ACT-541468 in man were largely confirmed in a single-ascending dose trial in healthy subjects. PBPK-PD modeling applied early in drug discovery, therefore, has great potential to assist in the identification of drug molecules when specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic requirements need to be met.'"

Healthy men and women (n = 72, 62 \xc2\xb1 8 yr, mean \xc2\xb1 SE) were enrolled into a 12-wk weight loss intervention. All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and a mixed-meal tolerance test before and after the intervention. BA were quantified in plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with whole genome exome sequencing and fecal microbiota profiling. Considering the average response of all 72 subjects, no effect of the successful weight loss intervention was found on plasma BA profiles. Fasting and postprandial BA profiles revealed high interindividual variability, and three main patterns in postprandial BA response were identified using multivariate analysis. Although the women enrolled were postmenopausal, effects of sex difference in BA response were evident. Exome data revealed the contribution of preselected genes to the observed interindividual variability. In particular, a variant in the SLCO1A2 gene, encoding the small intestinal BA transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide-1A2 (OATP1A2), was associated with delayed postprandial BA increases. Fecal microbiota analysis did not reveal evidence for a significant influence of bacterial diversity and/or composition on plasma BA profiles.

Evidence shows associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), however, these findings are based predominantly on duration measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour (e.g., minutes/week), with less attention on frequency measures (e.g., number of bouts). We examined the association of HRQoL with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, using both continuous duration (average daily minutes) and frequency (average daily bouts\xe2\x89\xa510 min) measures. Baseline data from the WALK 2.0 trial were analysed. WALK 2.0 is a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of Web 2.0 applications on engagement, retention, and subsequent physical activity change. Daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour (duration = average minutes, frequency = average number of bouts \xe2\x89\xa510 minutes) were measured (ActiGraph GT3X) across one week, and HRQoL was assessed with the 'general health' subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate associations. Participants (N = 504) were 50.8\xc2\xb113.1 (mean\xc2\xb1SD) years old with a BMI of 29.3\xc2\xb16.0. The 465 participants with valid accelerometer data engaged in an average of 24.0\xc2\xb118.3 minutes and 0.64\xc2\xb10.74 bouts of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day, 535.2\xc2\xb183.8 minutes and 17.0\xc2\xb13.4 bouts of sedentary behaviour per day, and reported moderate-high general HRQoL (64.5\xc2\xb120.0). After adjusting for covariates, the duration measures of physical activity (path correlation = 0.294, p<0.05) and sedentary behaviour were related to general HRQoL (path coefficient = -0.217, p<0.05). The frequency measure of physical activity was also significant (path coefficient = -0.226, p<0.05) but the frequency of sedentary behaviour was not significantly associated with general HRQoL. Higher duration levels of physical activity in fewer bouts, and lower duration of sedentary behaviour are associated with better general HRQoL. Further prospective studies are required to investigate these associations in different population groups over time."""

The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) after a median of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points were patient-reported toxicity, overall survival (OS), and distant disease-free survival. Results At a median estimated potential follow-up of 69 months, 5-year DFS was 87.9% (95% CI, 85.6% to 89.8%) in the EC-D arm and 88.3% (95% CI, 86.1% to 90.1%) in the DC arm.

A significant interaction between menopausal status and treatment group was observed for DFS ( P = .04) but not for OS ( P = .07). Patients with grade 3 tumors derived most benefit from DC, and patients with grade 1 to 2 tumors derived most benefit from EC-D (DFS: interaction P = .02; and OS: interaction P = .03). Patients receiving EC-D reported significantly more stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy, whereas edema was more frequent after DC.

IBIS-I was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer among women at increased risk of the disease. Participants and Methods Women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen versus placebo (20 mg/day; n = 4,279). After 456 exclusions, 3,823 women were included in this analysis. Adherence (< 4.5 years or \xe2\x89\xa5 4.5 years) was calculated using data from six monthly clinical visits. Analyses were adjusted for age, Tyrer-Cuzick risk, smoking, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, baseline menopausal symptoms, and treatment. Results Overall, 69.7% of women were adherent for at least 4.5 years (tamoxifen: 65.2% v placebo: 74.0%; P < .001). Differences in adherence between treatment arms were observed from 12 months onward (all P < .01) and were largest at 54 months. Dropout rates were highest in the first 12 to 18 months and decreased thereafter. Women reporting nausea/vomiting were less likely to be adherent in both the tamoxifen (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86; P = .007) and placebo (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; P = .023) arms. Headaches were associated with adherence only in the placebo arm (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.91; P = .016), whereas gynecologic symptoms were significant only in the tamoxifen arm (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = .024). Effect sizes for each symptom on adherence were not significantly different between the treatment groups ( P > .05). In both treatment arms, we observed significant trends for lower adherence with increasing severity for all symptoms ( P < .01) except headaches ( P = .054). Conclusion In the IBIS-I trial, experiencing predefined symptoms in the first 6 months reduced long-term adherence. Effects were similar between treatment arms, suggesting that women were attributing age-related symptoms to preventive therapy. Interventions were required to support symptom management.'"

AMY1 and AMY2 show copy number variations that affect differences in amylase amount and activity, and AMY1 copies have been associated with adiposity. We investigated whether genetic variants determining amylase gene copies are associated with 2-year changes in adiposity among 692 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned to diets varying in macronutrient content. We found that changes in body weight (BW) and waist circumference (WC) were significantly different according to the AMY1-AMY2 rs11185098 genotype. Individuals carrying the A allele (indicating higher amylase amount and activity) showed a greater reduction in BW and WC at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months than those without the A allele (P < 0.05 for all). The association was stronger for long-term changes compared with short-term changes of these outcomes. The genetic effects on these outcomes did not significantly differ across diet groups. In conclusion, the genetic variant determining starch metabolism influences the response to weight-loss dietary intervention. Overweight and obese individuals carrying the AMY1-AMY2 rs11185098 genotype associated with higher amylase activity may have greater loss of adiposity during low-calorie diet interventions.'"

The infants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or 1 or 2 mg Fe \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) from 6 wk to 6 mo of age. In secondary analyses at the age of 7 y, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the prevalence of children with BP within the hypertensive range (>90th percentile) were compared between the groups.Results: BP was analyzed via intention to treat in 189 children (66%). The mean \xc2\xb1 SD SBP was 103 \xc2\xb1 8.1, 101 \xc2\xb1 7.5, and 101 \xc2\xb1 7.8 mm Hg in children who had received the placebo (n = 70), 1 mg Fe \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) (n = 54), or 2 mg Fe \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1) (n = 65), respectively. When the iron-supplemented groups were combined in covariate-adjusted analyses, the mean SBP in LBW children who had received iron supplementation in infancy was 2.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.3, 4.2 mm Hg) lower than in those who were unsupplemented (P = 0.026). Multivariate logistic regression showed that iron supplementation in infancy reduced the odds of having an SBP within the hypertensive range at 7 y of age (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.96). For DBP, there were no significant differences between the intervention groups.Conclusions: LBW children who receive iron supplementation (1 or 2 mg Fe \xc2\xb7 kg(-1) \xc2\xb7 d(-1)) in infancy have lower SBP at 7 y. This (to our knowledge) novel observation suggests that the increased risk of hypertension that is observed in children and adults who are born small might be reduced with early micronutrient interventions.

As endoscopic therapies, such as endoscopic injection sclerotherapy or endoscopic band ligation for EVs, accompany invasive procedure and patients with EVs receiving endoscopic therapies mostly rest in bed during hospitalization, clarifying these issues are clinically of importance. The purposes of this study were therefore to examine changes in skeletal muscle mass for LC patients with EVs undergoing endoscopic therapy as a primary prophylaxis and to identify pretreatment predictors which are associated with the amelioration in skeletal muscle mass. This is a subgroup analysis in our previous randomized controlled trial. A total of 51 LC patients with EVs were analyzed. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed using bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as sum of skeletal muscle mass in body trunk and upper and lower extremities divided by height squared (cm/m) using data for BIA. We compared the changes in SMI at baseline and SMI at Day 50 after endoscopic treatment for EVs. Our study cohort included 33 males and 18 females with median (range) age of 62 (29-81) years. There were 31 patients with Child-Pugh A and 20 with Child-Pugh B. The median SMI for the entire cohort at baseline was 8.96\xe2\x80\x8acm/m (range, 5.87-13.11\xe2\x80\x8acm/m), while the median SMI for the entire cohort at Day 50 was 8.83\xe2\x80\x8acm/m (range, 5.59-12.29\xe2\x80\x8acm/m) (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.9995).

We evaluated whether inhibition of the inflammatory response by a single preoperative dose of methylprednisolone (MP) reduces the pronounced loss of knee-extension strength at discharge after fast-track TKA. Patients and methods - 70 patients undergoing elective unilateral TKA were randomized (1:1) to preoperative intravenous (IV) MP 125\xe2\x80\x89mg (group MP) or isotonic saline IV (group C). All procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia without tourniquet, and with a standardized multimodal analgesic regime. The primary outcome was change in knee-extension strength from baseline to 48\xe2\x80\x89hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were knee joint circumference, functional performance using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, pain during the aforementioned tests, rescue analgesic requirements, and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) changes. Results - 61 patients completed the follow-up. The loss in quadriceps muscle strength was similar between groups; group MP 1.04 (0.22-1.91) Nm/kg (-89%) vs. group C 1.02 (0.22-1.57) Nm/kg (-88%). Also between-group differences were similar for knee circumference, TUG test, and pain scores. MP reduced the inflammatory response (CRP) at 24\xe2\x80\x89hours postoperatively; group MP 33 (IQR 21-50) mg/L vs. group C 72 (IQR 58-92) mg/L (p < 0.001), and 48\xe2\x80\x89hours postoperatively; group MP 83 (IQR 56-125) mg/L vs. group C 192 (IQR 147-265) mg/L (p < 0.001), respectively. Interpretation - Preoperative systemic administration of MP 125\xe2\x80\x89mg did not reduce the pronounced loss of knee-extension strength or other functional outcomes at discharge after fast-track TKA despite a reduced systemic inflammatory response.'"

Human obesity is associated with altered incretin secretion and elevated endocannabinoid levels. Since cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) are expressed on incretin-secreting cells in rodents, we hypothesized that endocannabinoids are involved in the regulation of incretin secretion. We compared plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 20 lean and 20 obese participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Next, we recruited 20 healthy men to evaluate GIP and GLP-1 responses during OGTT after administering placebo or nabilone (CBR agonist) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Compared with the BLSA lean group, the BLSA obese group had significantly higher fasting and post-OGTT GIP levels, but similar fasting GLP-1 and significantly lower post-OGTT GLP-1 levels. In the nabilone vs. placebo study, when compared with placebo, nabilone resulted in significantly elevated post-dose fasting GIP levels and post-OGTT GIP levels, but no change in post-dose fasting GLP-1 levels together with significantly lower post-OGTT GLP-1 levels. Glucose levels were not different with both interventions. We conclude that elevated GIP levels in obesity are likely a consequence of increased endocannabinoid levels. CBRs exert tonic control over GIP secretion, which may have a homeostatic effect in suppressing GLP-1 secretion. This raises the possibility that gut hormones are influenced by endocannabinoids.'"

Methods: In this retrospective study, patients enrolled in the FOWARC study from January 2011 to July 2014 in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University were included. In the FOWARC study, enrolled patients with local advanced rectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Among these patients, 23 patients were selected as radiation proctitis (RP)group, who fulfilled these conditions: (1) received neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy followed by sphincter-preserving surgery; (2) developed radiation proctitis as confirmed by preoperative imaging diagnosis; (3) had intact clinical samples of surgical margins. Twenty-three patients who had received neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy but without development of radiation proctitis were selected as non-radiation proctitis (nRP) group. Meanwhile, 23 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy only were selected as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) group. Both nRP and CT cases were selected by ensuring the basic characteristics such as sex, age, tumor site, lengths of proximal margin and distal margin all maximally matched to the RP group. Both proximal and distal margins were collected for further analysis for all selected cases. Microscopy slices were prepared for hematoxylin & eosin staining and Masson staining to show general pathological changes, and also for immunohistochemistry with anti-CD-34 as primary antibody to reveal the microvessel. Microvessel counting in submucosal layer and proportion of macrovessel with stenosis were used to evaluate the blood supply of the proximal and distal end of anastomosis. A modified semi-quantitative grading approach was used to evaluate the severity of radiation-induced injury. Either ANOVA analysis, Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test or \xcf\x87(2) test was used for comparison among three groups, and Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between two groups. Results: Compared to group of neoadjuvant chemotherapy only, patients receiving neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy had lower microvessel count in both proximal and distal margins (M(Q(R)): proximal, 25.5 (19.6) vs. 50.0 (25.0), Z=3.915, P=0.000; distal, 20.5 (17.5) vs. 49.0 (28.0), Z=3.558, P=0.000), higher proportions of macrovessel with stenosis (proximal, 9.5% (23.8%) vs. 0, Z=3.993, P=0.000; distal, 11.5%(37.3%) vs. 0 (2.0%), Z=2.893, P=0.004), higher histopathologic score (proximal, 4.0 (2.0) vs. 1.0 (2.0), Z=6.123, P=0.000; distal, 5.0 (3.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0), Z=4.849, P=0.000). In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, compared to nRP group, RP group had lower microvessel count in both proximal and distal margins (proximal, 19.0 (23.0) vs. 30.4 (38.0), Z=2.845, P=0.004; distal, 19.0 (13.0) vs. 30.0(29.1), Z=2.022, P=0.043), higher proportions of macrovessel with stenosis (proximal, 23.0% (40.0%) vs. 0(11.0%), Z=3.248, P=0.001; distal, 27.0% (45.0%) vs. 3.0% (19.0%), Z=2.164, P=0.030). Rate of anastomotic leakage for CT, nRP and RP group were 8.7% (2/23), 30.4% (7/23), and 52.2% (12/23), and the differences among three groups were statistically significant (\xcf\x87(2)=10.268, P=0.007).

Several studies have looked at the association between magnesium and depression, yet its role in symptom management is unclear. The objective of this trial was to test whether supplementation with over-the-counter magnesium chloride improves symptoms of depression. An open-label, blocked, randomized, cross-over trial was carried out in outpatient primary care clinics on 126 adults (mean age 52; 38% male) diagnosed with and currently experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores of 5-19. The intervention was 6 weeks of active treatment (248 mg of elemental magnesium per day) compared to 6 weeks of control (no treatment). Assessments of depression symptoms were completed at bi-weekly phone calls. The primary outcome was the net difference in the change in depression symptoms from baseline to the end of each treatment period. Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety symptoms as well as adherence to the supplement regimen, appearance of adverse effects, and intention to use magnesium supplements in the future. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magnesium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P<0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P<0.001). Average adherence was 83% by pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61% of participants reported they would use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treatments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moderate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close monitoring for toxicity.'"

Therefore, as a primary outcome-related analysis from a randomized prevention trial, we examined the long-term influence of this intervention on deaths as a result of and after breast cancer during 8.5 years (median) of dietary intervention and cumulatively for all breast cancers diagnosed during 16.1 years (median) of follow-up. Patients and Methods The trial randomly assigned 48,835 postmenopausal women with normal mammograms and without prior breast cancer from 1993 to 1998 at 40 US clinical centers to a dietary intervention with goals of a reduction of fat intake to 20% of energy and an increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains (40%; n = 19,541) or to a usual diet comparison (60%; n = 29,294). Results In the dietary group, fat intake and body weight decreased (all P < .001). During the 8.5-year dietary intervention, with 1,764 incident breast cancers, fewer deaths occurred as a result of breast cancer in the dietary group, which was not statistically significant (27 deaths [0.016% per year] v 61 deaths [0.024% per year]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.06; P = .08). During the same period, deaths after breast cancer (n = 134) were significantly reduced (40 deaths [0.025% per year] v 94 deaths [0.038% per year]; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94; P = .02) by the dietary intervention. During the 16.1-year follow-up, with 3,030 incident breast cancers, deaths after breast cancer also were significantly reduced (234 deaths [0.085% per year] v 443 deaths [0.11% per year]; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = .01) in the dietary group. Conclusion Compared with a usual diet comparison group, a low-fat dietary pattern led to a lower incidence of deaths after breast cancer."""

However, its bioavailability can vary, depending on the food matrix and host factors. Recently, it has been suggested that divalent minerals negatively impinge on carotenoid bioavailability by reducing bile-salt and non-esterified fatty-acid levels in the gut, which normally aid in emulsifying carotenoids. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether supplemental Ca would negatively influence carotenoid absorption in humans. A total of twenty-five healthy, non-obese men (age: 20-46 years, BMI<30 kg/m2) were recruited for this postprandial, randomised, crossover, double-blinded trial. Following a randomised block design, each participant received (after 2-week washout periods), on three occasions separated by 1 week, 270 g of spinach-based meals (8\xc2\xb761 (sd 1\xc2\xb708) mg carotenoids/100 g fresh weight), supplemented with 0, 500 or 1000 mg of Ca (as calcium carbonate), with each participant acting as his or her own control. Blood samples were collected at regular postprandial intervals for up to 10 h following test meal intake, and standardised lunches were served. TAG-rich lipoprotein fractions were separated and carotenoid concentrations determined. AUC for meals without supplemented Ca were 22\xc2\xb772 (sem 2\xc2\xb778) nmol\xc3\x97h/l (lutein), 0\xc2\xb719 (sem 3\xc2\xb790) nmol\xc3\x97h/l (\xce\xb2-carotene) and 2\xc2\xb780 (sem 1\xc2\xb775) nmol\xc3\x97h/l (\xce\xb2-cryptoxanthin). No significant influence of supplementation with either 500 or 1000 mg of supplemental Ca was found. In conclusion, Ca - the most abundant divalent mineral in the diet - given at high but physiological concentrations, does not appear to have repercussions on the bioavailability of carotenoids from a spinach-based meal.'"

Methods: Forty-four patients with deeply burned hands, conforming to the study criteria were admitted to Department of Burns and Reconstructive Surgery of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 2014 to June 2015. Patients were divided into propaganda education rehabilitation group (PER, n=23) and specially-assigned person rehabilitation group (SAPR, n=21) according to the random number table and patients' willingness. On post injury day 3 to 7, 36 burned hands in group PER and 33 burned hands in group SAPR underwent operation of retaining denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin. Patients in 2 groups received anti-scar treatment of hands with silicone gel from postoperative day 10. Besides, patients in group PER underwent active functional exercise under guidance of duty nurse and received psychological guidance from duty nurse with grade two psychological consultant certificate. Patients in group SAPR underwent active and passive functional exercise under guidance of rehabilitation therapist and received psychological guidance from psychotherapist with intermediate title. In postoperative month (POM) 1, 3 and 6, ranges of active motion of burned finger joints of patients in 2 groups were measured with joint goniometer to calculate excellent and good ratio of total active motion (TAM) range. Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients were measured with electronic hand dynamometer, and psychological anxiety was scored with Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Data were processed with chi-square test, independent sample t test, McNemar test, analysis of variance of repeated measurement, SNK test and Bonferroni correction. Results: (1) Ratio of excellent and good of TAM range of burned finger joints of patients in group SAPR in POM 6 was obviously higher than that in group PER (\xcf\x87(2)=10.745, P<0.0167 ).

(2) Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients in group SAPR in POM 1, 3, and 6 were respectively (8.2\xc2\xb12.6), (21.6\xc2\xb12.6) and (30.1\xc2\xb12.3) kg, obviously higher than those in group PER [ (5.3\xc2\xb11.3), (12.8\xc2\xb12.7), (20.0\xc2\xb11.8) kg, respectively, with t values from 5.934 to 20.403, P values below 0.01]. Values of grip strength of burned hands of patients in 2 groups in POM 3 and 6 were obviously higher than those at the previous time point of the same group (with P values below 0.05). (3) SAS scores of patients in group SAPR in POM 1, 3 and 6 were significantly lower than those in group PER (with t values from 2.944 to 4.758, P values below 0.01). SAS scores of patients in 2 groups in POM 3 and 6 were significantly lower than those at the previous time point of the same group (with P values below 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with rehabilitation of propaganda and education, rehabilitation under specially-assigned person can improve TAM range of burned finger joints, value of grip strength, and psychological anxiety of patients with deeply burned hands retaining the denatured dermis and grafting large autologous skin."""

Methods: From 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2015, a random, open, multi-center and parallel control intervention study was conducted in 328 MSM enrolled by non-probability sampling in Chengdu. The MSM were divided into 3 groups randomly, i.e. daily group, intermittent group (before and after exposure) and control group. Clinical follow-up and questionnaire survey were carried out every 3 months. Their PrEP compliances were evaluated respectively and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the related factors. Results: A total of 141 MSM were surveyed, in whom 59(41.8%) had good PrEP compliancy. The PrEP compliancy rate was 69.0% in daily group, higher than that in intermittent group (14.3%), the difference had significance (\xcf\x87(2)=45.29,P<0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that type of PrEP was the influencing factors of PrEP compliancy. Compared with daily group, the intermittent group had worse PrEP compliancy (OR=0.07, 95%CI: 0.03-0.16). Conclusion: The PrEP compliance of the MSM in this study was poor, the compliancy would be influenced by the type of PrEP.'"

Recent studies suggest that IFN-\xce\xb3 is a critical driver of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in cancer and host cells, and baseline intratumoral T cell infiltration may improve response likelihood to anti-PD-1 therapies, including pembrolizumab. However, whether quantifying T cell-inflamed microenvironment is a useful pan-tumor determinant of PD-1-directed therapy response has not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles (GEPs) using RNA from baseline tumor samples of pembrolizumab-treated patients. We identified immune-related signatures correlating with clinical benefit using a learn-and-confirm paradigm based on data from different clinical studies of pembrolizumab, starting with a small pilot of 19 melanoma patients and eventually defining a pan-tumor T cell-inflamed GEP in 220 patients with 9 cancers. Predictive value was independently confirmed and compared with that of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in 96 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The T cell-inflamed GEP contained IFN-\xce\xb3-responsive genes related to antigen presentation, chemokine expression, cytotoxic activity, and adaptive immune resistance, and these features were necessary, but not always sufficient, for clinical benefit.

The experimental facilities formed local change teams and were provided external coaching based on the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) process improvement model. Difference-indifference analyses indicate a significant relative increase in HIV testing in the experimental compared to the control condition.

CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism rs12459419 C>T in the splice enhancer region regulates the expression of an alternatively spliced CD33 isoform lacking exon2 (D2-CD33), thus eliminating the CD33 IgV domain, which is the antibody-binding site for GO, as well as diagnostic immunophenotypic panels. We aimed to determine the impact of the genotype of this splicing polymorphism in patients with AML treated with GO-containing chemotherapy. Patients and Methods CD33 splicing single nucleotide polymorphism was evaluated in newly diagnosed patients with AML randomly assigned to receive standard five-course chemotherapy alone (No-GO arm, n = 408) or chemotherapy with the addition of two doses of GO once during induction and once during intensification (GO arm, n = 408) as per the Children's Oncology Group AAML0531 trial. Results The rs12459419 genotype was CC in 415 patients (51%), CT in 316 patients (39%), and TT in 85 patients (10%), with a minor allele frequency of 30%. The T allele was significantly associated with higher levels of D2-CD33 transcript ( P < 1.0E(-6)) and with lower diagnostic leukemic cell surface CD33 intensity ( P < 1.0E(-6)). Patients with the CC genotype had significantly lower relapse risk in the GO arm than in the No-GO arm (26% v 49%; P < .001). However, in patients with the CT or TT genotype, exposure to GO did not influence relapse risk (39% v 40%; P = .85). Disease-free survival was higher in patients with the CC genotype in the GO arm than in the No-GO arm (65% v 46%, respectively; P = .004), but this benefit of GO addition was not seen in patients with the CT or TT genotype. Conclusion Our results suggest that patients with the CC genotype for rs12459419 have a substantial response to GO, making this a potential biomarker for the selection of patients with a likelihood of significant response to GO."""

We report prespecified subgroup analyses of outcomes in participants with baseline CKD in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial. We randomly assigned participants to a systolic BP target of <120 mm Hg (intensive group; n=1330) or <140 mm Hg (standard group; n=1316). After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 112 intensive group and 131 standard group CKD participants (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.63 to 1.05). The intensive group also had a lower rate of all-cause death (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99). Treatment effects did not differ between participants with and without CKD (P values for interactions \xe2\x89\xa50.30). The prespecified main kidney outcome, defined as the composite of \xe2\x89\xa550% decrease in eGFR from baseline or ESRD, occurred in 15 intensive group and 16 standard group participants (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.83). After the initial 6 months, the intensive group had a slightly higher rate of change in eGFR (-0.47 versus -0.32 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year; P<0.03). The overall rate of serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, although some specific adverse events occurred more often in the intensive group. Thus, among patients with CKD and hypertension without diabetes, targeting an SBP<120 mm Hg compared with <140 mm Hg reduced rates of major cardiovascular events and all-cause death without evidence of effect modifications by CKD or deleterious effect on the main kidney outcome.'"

Previously, we showed that preterm-born infants fed an isocaloric protein- and mineral-enriched postdischarge formula (PDF) from term age to 6-mo corrected age (CA) gained more lean mass than did those fed term formula (TF). Long-term follow-up of randomized nutritional trials is important to test the hypothesis that short-term positive effects on health are sustainable.Objective: The aim of this follow-up study was to compare body size, body composition, and metabolic health at age 8 y in preterm-born children who were randomly assigned to receive either PDF or TF from term age until 6-mo CA.Design: A total of 79 of 152 children (52%) from the original randomized controlled trial were enrolled for follow-up at age 8 y. Weight, height, and head circumference were measured by using standard methods. Body composition, including fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density, was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Blood pressure was measured in the supine position by using an automatic device. Metabolic variables, including glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, triglycerides, cholesterol, cortisol, and leptin, were measured after an overnight fast. Nutritional habits at age 8 y were assessed by using a 3-d nutritional diary.Results: At age 8 y, no differences were found in body size, body composition, bone variables, and metabolic health variables when comparing children fed PDF with those fed TF. Adjustment for known and possible confounders did not change these results.Conclusions: In this follow-up study in preterm-born children, we showed that the favorable effects of PDF at 6-mo CA either were not maintained or could not be confirmed because of attrition at the age of 8 y. We suggest that future research should focus on nutritional interventions in the pre- and postdischarge period as a continuum rather than as separate entities. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR 2972 (follow-up study [STEP-2 (Study Towards the Effects of Post-discharge Nutrition 2)]) and NTR 55 [original randomized controlled trial (STEP)].'"

Through examination of levels of substance P (SP) and mucin (MUC)5B in nasal lavage fluid, the mechanisms of nasal irrigation treatment for VMR was discussed. Methods: One hundred and one patients from Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University with VMR were randomly divided into 4 groups. The number of patients was 24 in control group, 25 in budesonide nasal spray treatment group (budesonide group), 25 in nasal irrigation treatment group (nasal irrigation group) and 27 in budesonide nasal spray + nasal irrigation group (combined treatment group). Control patients were left untreated. Budesonide group was under budesonide nasal spray treatment, nasal irrigation group was treated using 3.0% saline with a temperature of 40\xe2\x84\x83 and combined treatment group was given both treatments. The duration of the intervention period was 3 months (90 days). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate nasal symptoms, and the health-related quality of life was assessed using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-12v2). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the contents of SP and MUC5B in nasal lavage fluid before and after 3-month treatments in budesonide and nasal irrigation group in the study. MUC5B in nasal lavage fluid after the SP challenge and anticholinergic drug intervention in control group were also evaluated with ELISA. Results: Nighty out of 101 patients completed the study. In the budesonide and combined treatment group after relevant interventions, the total VAS score of nasal symptoms decreased (5.91\xc2\xb10.21 vs 3.82\xc2\xb10.15, 6.18\xc2\xb10.17 vs 3.92\xc2\xb10.15, t value was 8.193, 10.060, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score increased (146.00\xc2\xb11.23 vs 152.30\xc2\xb10.97, 146.00\xc2\xb11.08 vs 155.40\xc2\xb10.90, t value was 3.982, 6.697, respectively, all P<0.05), with both scores showed no significant differences in the nasal irrigation group (5.96\xc2\xb10.17 vs 5.72\xc2\xb10.15, 146.10\xc2\xb11.17 vs 147.00\xc2\xb10.94, t value was 1.038, 0.607, respectively, all P>0.05) after the first month. In the budesonide and combined treatment group after relevant interventions, the total VAS score of nasal symptoms decreased (5.91\xc2\xb10.21 vs 5.05\xc2\xb10.15, 6.18\xc2\xb10.17 vs 5.10\xc2\xb10.12, t value was 3.374, 5.351, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score increased (146.00\xc2\xb11.23 vs 150.90\xc2\xb10.76, 146.00\xc2\xb11.08 vs 153.60\xc2\xb10.94, t value was 3.373, 5.343, respectively, all P<0.05), with both scores showed no significant differences in the nasal irrigation group (5.96\xc2\xb10.17 vs 5.78\xc2\xb10.17, 146.10\xc2\xb11.17 vs 148.10\xc2\xb10.80, t value was 0.716, 1.438, respectively, all P>0.05) after the second month. By the end of the third month, in nasal irrigation and combined treatment group, the VAS score was diminished (5.96\xc2\xb10.17 vs 4.80\xc2\xb10.12, 6.18\xc2\xb10.17 vs 4.44\xc2\xb10.13, t value was 5.485, 8.264, respectively, all P<0.05) and SF-12v2 score was elevated (146.10\xc2\xb11.17 vs 150.80\xc2\xb10.96, 146.00\xc2\xb11.08 vs 152.90\xc2\xb10.85, t value was 3.163, 5.008, respectively, all P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in budesonide group (5.91\xc2\xb10.21 vs 5.68\xc2\xb10.18, 146.00\xc2\xb11.23 vs 148.40\xc2\xb10.85, t value was 0.819, 1.587, respectively, all P>0.05). Additionally, SP in nasal lavage fluid decreased and MUC5B showed no statistical changes in budesonide group after three months, however, SP showed no any changes and MUC5B reduced significantly in nasal lavage fluid in nasal irrigation group. Furthermore, the anticholinergic drug could not decrease the concentration of MUC5B after the SP challenge in nasal cavity in control group. Conclusions: The therapeutic effect of simple nasal irrigation with 3.0% saline or combined treatment of 3.0% saline nasal irrigation and nasal corticosteroids is superior to simple nasal corticosteroids. Nasal corticosteroids plays a role in the inhibition of sensory nerve endings in nasal mucosa, but neurotransmitter plays a limited role in the pathogenesis of VMR.'"

In this study, we evaluated silymarin efficacy in prevention of capecitabine-induced HFS in patients with gastrointestinal cancers, as the first human study. During this pilot, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effect of silymarin gel 1%, which is applied on the palms and soles twice daily starting at the first day of chemotherapy for 9\xc2\xa0weeks, on HFS occurrence was assessed. Forty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria assigned to the silymarin or placebo group. World Health Organization HFS grading scale scores were recorded at baseline and every 3\xc2\xa0weeks during these 9\xc2\xa0weeks. The median WHO HFS scores were significantly lower in silymarin group at the end of the 9(th) week (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.05). The scores increased significantly in both placebo and silymarin groups during chemotherapy, but there was a delay for HFS development and progression in silymarin group.

Patients and Methods A total of 299 patients (149 randomly assigned to cytarabine plus idarubicin [AI] and 150 assigned to cytarabine plus high-dose daunorubicin [AD]) were analyzed. All patients received cytarabine (200 mg/m(2)/d for 7 days). Results Complete remission (CR) was induced in 232 patients (77.6%), with no difference in CR rates between the AI and AD arms (80.5% v 74.7%, respectively; P = .224). At a median follow-up time of 34.9 months, survival and relapse rates did not differ between the AI and AD arms (4-year overall survival, 51.1% v 54.7%, respectively; P = .756; cumulative incidence of relapse, 35.2% v 25.1%, respectively; P = .194; event-free survival, 45.5% v 50.8%, respectively; P = .772). Toxicity profiles were also similar in the two arms. Interestingly, overall and event-free survival times of patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation were significantly different (AI v AD: median overall survival, 15.5 months v not reached, respectively; P = .030; event-free survival, 11.9 months v not reached, respectively; P = .028). Conclusion This phase III trial comparing idarubicin with high-dose daunorubicin did not find significant differences in CR rates, relapse, and survival. Significant interaction between the treatment arm and the FLT3-ITD mutation was found, and high-dose daunorubicin was more effective than idarubicin in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation.'"

Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to docetaxel or cabazitaxel. Men who did not achieve \xe2\x89\xa5 30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline by cycle 4 (C4) switched taxane. The primary clinical endpoint was confirmed \xe2\x89\xa5 50% PSA decline versus historical control (TAX327). The primary biomarker endpoint was analysis of post-treatment CTCs to confirm the hypothesis that clinical response was associated with taxane drug-target engagement, evidenced by decreased percent androgen receptor nuclear localization (%ARNL) and increased microtubule bundling. Results Sixty-three patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel (n = 41) or cabazitaxel (n = 22); 44.4% received prior potent androgen receptor-targeted therapy. Overall, 35 patients (55.6%) had confirmed \xe2\x89\xa5 50% PSA responses, exceeding the historical control rate of 45.4% (TAX327). Of 61 treated patients, 33 (54.1%) had \xe2\x89\xa5 30% PSA declines by C4 and did not switch taxane, 15 patients (24.6%) who did not achieve \xe2\x89\xa5 30% PSA declines by C4 switched taxane, and 13 patients (21.3%) discontinued therapy before or at C4. Of patients switching taxane, 46.7% subsequently achieved \xe2\x89\xa5 50% PSA decrease. In 26 CTC-evaluable patients, taxane-induced decrease in %ARNL (cycle 1 day 1 v cycle 1 day 8) was associated with a higher rate of \xe2\x89\xa5 50% PSA decrease at C4 ( P = .009). Median composite progression-free survival was 9.1 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 11.7 months); median overall survival was not reached at 14 months. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included fatigue (13.1%) and febrile neutropenia (11.5%). Conclusion The early taxane switch strategy was associated with improved PSA response rates versus TAX327. Taxane-induced shifts in %ARNL may serve as an early biomarker of clinical benefit in patients treated with taxanes.'"

The subjects comprising the study groups were given traditional therapy in the combination with the intake of homeovox whereas the patients included in the two groups of comparison received the traditional treatment alone. The outcome of the treatment was evaluated on days 1, 5, and 10 after the initiation of therapy based on the analysis of the changes in the videoendostroboscopic picture of the larynx and the acoustic characteristics obtained by the computer-assisted analysis of the voice. The analysis of the results of the combined treatment has demonstrated the statistically significant differences in some acoustic parameters of the voice between the subjects with small vocal cord nodules and acute laryngitis belonging to the study groups and the groups of comparison. It is concluded that the introduction of homeovox in the combined treatment of the patients presenting with the small nodules in the vocal cords and acute catarrhal laryngitis accelerates the recovery of the acoustic characteristics of the voice within various periods after the onset of the treatment in comparison with the patients treated with the use of traditional therapy alone.'"

Indices were compared over time, between initial shunt type [modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) and right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS)] and in relation to clinical outcomes. S velocities and VTI increased over time while D wave was stable, resulting in increasing S/D peak velocity and VTI ratios, with a median post-Norwood S/D VTI ratio of 1.14 versus 1.38 at pre-stage II and 1.89 at 14\xc2\xa0months (P\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.0001 between intervals).

Obesity is common among African American women and contributes to breast cancer progression and numerous chronic conditions. Weight loss interventions among breast cancer survivors positively affect weight, behavior, biomarkers, and psychosocial outcomes, yet few target African Americans. This article examines the effects of Moving Forward, a weight loss intervention for African American breast cancer survivors (AABCS) on weight, body composition, and behavior. Patients and Methods Early-stage (I-III) AABCS were randomly assigned to a 6-month interventionist-guided (n = 125) or self-guided (n = 121) weight loss program supporting behavioral changes to promote a 5% weight loss. Anthropometric, body composition, and behavioral data were collected at baseline, postintervention (6 months), and follow-up (12 months). Descriptive statistics and mixed models analyses assessed differences between groups over time. Results Mean (\xc2\xb1 standard deviation) age, and body mass index were 57.5 (\xc2\xb1 10.1) years and 36.1 (\xc2\xb1 6.2) kg/m(2), respectively, and 82% had stage I or II breast cancer. Both groups lost weight. Mean and percentage of weight loss were greater in the guided versus self-guided group (at 6 months: 3.5 kg v 1.3kg; P < .001; 3.6% v 1.4%; P < .001, respectively; at 12 months: 2.7 kg v 1.6 kg; P < .05; 2.6% v 1.6%; P < .05, respectively); 44% in the guided group and 19% in the self-guided group met the 5% goal. Body composition and behavioral changes were also greater in the interventionist-guided group at both time points. Conclusion The study supports the efficacy of a community-based interventionist-guided weight loss program targeting AABCS. Although mean weight loss did not reach the targeted 5%, the mean loss of > 3% at 6 months is associated with improved health outcomes. Affordable, accessible health promotion programs represent a critical resource for AABCS.'"

Both methods have good effect individually. We hypothesized that a continuous ACB added to a single-dose LIA would lower pain scores while ambulating on postoperative day 1 (POD1) and postoperative day 2 (POD2). Patients and methods - 69 participants were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The TKA was performed under spinal analgesia and every participant was given single-dose LIA intraoperatively. Patients were then randomized into 2 groups, treatment group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine and control group receiving normal saline. First a 20\xe2\x80\x89mL bolus was given into the adductor canal and 4\xe2\x80\x89hours later a continuous flow at 6\xe2\x80\x89mL/h was initiated for 2 postoperative days through a catheter placed in the adductor canal. Results - Worst pain score during movement of the operated knee on POD1 and POD2 was similar between the groups. No other ambulation tests done on POD1 and POD2 showed any statistically significant difference. Morphine consumption on the day of surgery, POD1 and POD2 was similar between the groups. Interpretation - The results indicate no benefit of continuous infusion ACB added to a single-dose LIA compared with LIA alone on pain while ambulating on POD1 and POD2. Furthermore, the ACB showed no superiority in ambulation ability on the 2 postoperative days.'"

Participants received 4 weeks of supplementation with LCPUFA-containing oil (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 300 mg/day, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 100 mg/day, arachidonic acid (ARA) 120 mg/day) or a placebo oil. Mood was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before and after supplementation as the secondary outcome in a previously performed randomized controlled trial on cognitive function. A total of 113 participants completed the supplementation period. One hundred participants (LCPUFA, n = 51; placebo, n = 49) who were eligible for evaluation of mood were analyzed. Increases in vigor scores on POMS, reflecting a positive mood, were significantly larger in the LCPUFA group than in the placebo group (LCPUFA, +1.8; placebo, -0.5). No significant differences were observed in changes in other negative mood scores between groups. DHA and ARA content in plasma phospholipids were increased by 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively, in the LCPUFA group, and were significantly larger than those in the placebo group.

Yet, the function of these oscillations, and their expression in humans, remain elusive. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural oscillations in a task that simulated approach-avoidance conflict, wherein 23 male and female human participants collected monetary tokens under a threat of virtual predation. Probability of threat was signaled by color and learned beforehand by direct experience. Magnitude of threat corresponded to a possible monetary loss, signaled as a quantity. We focused our analyses on an a priori defined region-of-interest, the bilateral hippocampus. Oscillatory power under conflict was linearly predicted by threat probability in a location consistent with right mid-hippocampus. This pattern was specific to the hippocampus, most pronounced in the gamma band, and not explained by spatial movement or anxiety-like behavior. Gamma power was modulated by slower theta rhythms, and this theta modulation increased with threat probability. Furthermore, theta oscillations in the same location showed greater synchrony with mPFC theta with increased threat probability. Strikingly, these findings were not seen in relation to an increase in threat magnitude, which was explicitly signaled as a quantity and induced similar behavioral responses as learned threat probability. Thus, our findings suggest that the expression of hippocampal and mPFC oscillatory activity in the context of anxiety is specifically linked to threat memory. These findings resonate with neurocomputational accounts of the role played by hippocampal oscillations in memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a biologically relevant approach-avoidance conflict test in humans while recording neural oscillations with magnetoencephalography to investigate the expression and function of hippocampal oscillations in human anxiety. Extending nonhuman studies, we can assign a possible function to hippocampal oscillations in this task, namely threat memory communication. This blends into recent attempts to elucidate the role of brain synchronization in defensive responses to threat.'"

We further explored factors related to sustained recovery.Design: We conducted a cluster-randomized clinical effectiveness trial involving rural Malawian children aged 6-62 mo who were enrolled on discharge from an SFP for MAM. We enrolled 718 children at 10 control sites and 769 children at 11 intervention sites. In addition to routine health and nutrition counseling, the intervention group received a package of health and nutrition interventions that consisted of a lipid nutrient supplement, deworming medication, zinc supplementation, a bed net, and malaria chemoprophylaxis. A survival analysis was used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention as well as to identify factors associated with sustained recovery.Results: Of 1383 children who returned for the full 12-mo follow-up period, 407 children (56%) and 347 children (53%) sustained recovery in the intervention and control groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in relapse-free survival curves between the treatment and control groups (P = 0.380; log-rank test). The risk factors for relapse or death after initial recovery were a smaller midupper arm circumference on SFP admission (P = 0.01) and discharge (P < 0.001), a lower weight-for-height z score on discharge (P < 0.01), and the receipt of ready-to-use supplementary food as opposed to ready-to-use therapeutic food during treatment (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The provision of a package of health and nutrition services in addition to traditional SFP treatment has no significant effect on improving sustained recovery in children after treatment of MAM.

Iron supplementation is recommended in populations in which anemia prevalence is high. However, there are issues of cost, distribution, and adherence. A potential alternative is a reusable fish-shaped iron ingot, which, when added to the cooking pot, leaches iron into the fluid in which it is prepared.Objective: We sought to determine whether there was a difference in hemoglobin concentrations in rural Cambodian anemic women (aged 18-49 y) who cooked with the iron ingot or consumed a daily iron supplement compared with a control after 1 y.Design: In Preah Vihear, 340 women with mild or moderate anemia were randomly assigned to 1) an iron-ingot group, 2) an iron-supplement (18 mg/d) group, or 3) a nonplacebo control group. A venous blood sample was taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 mo. Blood was analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was used to detect structural hemoglobin variants.Results: Anemia prevalence was 44% with the use of a portable hemoglobinometer during screening. At baseline, prevalence of iron deficiency was 9% on the basis of a low serum ferritin concentration. There was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin concentrations between the iron-ingot group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 118 g/L; P = 0.850) or iron-supplement group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 117 g/L; P = 0.998) compared with the control group (115 g/L; 95% CI: 113, 117 g/L) at 12 mo.

However, it is unknown whether multiple sessions of rTMS improve cognitive control, which is a function of the neural circuitry of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-cingulate cortex in healthy individuals. In addition, it is still unclear which stages of neural processing are altered by rTMS. In this study, we investigated the effects of high-frequency rTMS on cognitive control and explored the time course changes of cognitive processing after rTMS using event-related potentials (ERPs). For seven consecutive days, 25 young healthy participants underwent one 10-Hz rTMS session per day in which stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC, and a homogeneous participant group of 25 individuals received a sham rTMS treatment. A Stroop task was performed, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The results revealed that multiple sessions of rTMS can decrease reaction time (RTs) under both congruent and incongruent conditions and also increased the amplitudes of both N2 and N450 compared with sham rTMS. The negative correlations between the mean amplitudes of both N2 and N450 and the RTs were found, however, the latter correlation were restricted to incongruent trials and the correlation was enhanced significantly by rTMS. This observation supports the view that high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC can not only recruit more neural resources from the prefrontal cortex by inducing an electrophysiologically excitatory effect but also enhance efficiency of resources to deploy for conflict resolution during multiple stages of cognitive control processing in healthy young people.'"

This prespecified subanalysis investigated the effect of age on the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, phase III study enrolled patients with histologically confirmed RR-DTC stratified by age (\xe2\x89\xa4 65 or > 65 years). Patients (N = 392) received lenvatinib 24 mg/day (n = 261) or placebo (n = 131). The primary end point was PFS; secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and safety. Results In both treatment arms, median ages were 56 (younger group) and 71 years (older group). PFS benefit was maintained with lenvatinib versus placebo in the younger and older age groups, with median PFS of 20.2 versus 3.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.27; P < .001) and 16.7 versus 3.7 months (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.43; P < .001), respectively. PFS did not differ with age in either treatment arm. OS was improved in older lenvatinib-treated patients versus placebo (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.91; P = .020). Younger lenvatinib-treated patients showed significantly higher ORR (72% v 55%; P = .0038), longer time to first dose reduction (3.7 v 1.5 months), and lower proportion of grade \xe2\x89\xa5 3 treatment-related adverse events (67% v 89%; P < .001) compared with older patients. Conclusion This subanalysis demonstrated improved PFS with lenvatinib treatment versus placebo in both age groups, although higher toxicity was observed in older patients. Despite the allowance of crossover after disease progression, the OS benefit was observed in older patients, suggesting that lenvatinib should be considered for treatment of patients of any age with RR-DTC.'"

Each therapy targets specific patient populations: Kalydeco treats patients carrying one of nine gating mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, whereas Orkambi treats patients homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation. In this study, we explored the pharmacological and metabolic effects of precision deuteration chemistry on ivacaftor by synthesizing two novel deuterated ivacaftor analogs, CTP-656 (d9-ivacaftor) and d18-ivacaftor. Ivacaftor is administered twice daily and is extensively converted in humans to major metabolites M1 and M6; therefore, the corresponding deuterated metabolites were also prepared. Both CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor showed in vitro pharmacologic potency similar to that in ivacaftor, and the deuterated M1 and M6 metabolites showed pharmacology equivalent to that in the corresponding metabolites of ivacaftor, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies of deuterated compounds. However, CTP-656 exhibited markedly enhanced stability when tested in vitro. The deuterium isotope effects for CTP-656 metabolism ((D)V = 3.8, (D)V/K = 2.2) were notably large for a cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CTP-656 and d18-ivacaftor were assessed in six healthy volunteers in a single-dose crossover study, which provided the basis for advancing CTP-656 in development. The overall PK profile, including the 15.9-hour half-life for CTP-656, suggests that CTP-656 may be dosed once daily, thereby enhancing patient adherence. Together, these data continue to validate deuterium substitution as a viable approach for creating novel therapeutic agents with properties potentially differentiated from existing drugs.'"

A promising strategy to reduce this post-laparoscopic pain is the pulmonary recruitment maneuver, which indirectly increases intraperitoneal pressure and thereby facilitates removal of residual carbon dioxide.

Study Design Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting Sixty-nine secondary and tertiary sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Subjects and Methods In total, 343 subjects with persistent acute tinnitus after traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media were randomized to receive 3 intratympanic doses of either AM-101 0.87 mg/mL or placebo over 3 to 5 days. They were followed for 84 days. The primary safety end point was the incidence of a clinically meaningful hearing deterioration from baseline to study day 35. Further safety assessments included tympanic membrane closure rates, analysis of adverse events, hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs. In addition, data were collected on applied anesthetics and injection techniques. Results The treatment was well tolerated, with no intervention-related serious adverse events. The incidence of clinically meaningful hearing deterioration was low, comparable between treatment groups ( P = .82 for the primary safety end point) and not different between treated and untreated ears in unilaterally treated subjects. The rate of treatment and procedure-related adverse events was similar among treatment groups. The tympanic membrane was closed in 92% of subjects within 1 week and in all subjects by study day 84. Blood values and vital signs were inconspicuous. Conclusion Repeated intratympanic injections of AM-101 over a 3- to 5-day period appear to be safe and well tolerated, demonstrating the ability to potentially use this delivery approach over longer time periods.'"

This is a post hoc analysis of the renal substudy of the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial). A total of 13 071 eligible participants without proteinuria were randomized to receive a double-blind daily treatment of a single tablet containing 10-mg enalapril and 0.8-mg folic acid (n=6511) or 10-mg enalapril alone (n=6560). The primary outcome was new-onset proteinuria, defined as a urine dipstick reading of \xe2\x89\xa51+ at the exit visit.

Methods: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. From March to June in 2012, 102 patients (102 eyes) with age-related cataract were treated with phacoemulsification at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, and these eyes were randomly divided into blank group (group A ) 32 cases, treatment group 1 (group B) 35 cases and treatment group 2 (group C) 35 cases. Group A was treated with conventional antibiotics. Group B was sodium hyaluronate eye drop, group C was lipid-containing carbomer gel respectively. All patients finished a dry eye questionnaire called Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), and Schimmer's test (SIt), break up time (BUT) and fluorescein staining (FL) tests were performed before surgery and at 7, 30 and 90 days after surgery respectively. Optometry were performed at 90 days after surgery. The \xcf\x87(2) test was used to analyze the sex of the patients, and the age of the patients was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Partial data in eye tests and in OSDI does not meet the normal distribution. Therefore, they were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis H test. If significant difference existed, these data were then analyzed by independent sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Twelve patients were lost to visit within 3 months. A total of 90 patients were followed up for 90 days. The mean age of all patients was (69.5\xc2\xb19.5) years (46.0-89.0 years), 38 males and 64 females. There were 30 patients in Group A, group B and group C respectively. The prevalence of dry eye was 56. 7% (60/102). There was no significant difference among the three groups (P>0.05). OSDI questionnaire showed that OSDI score was significantly different among the three groups at 7, 30 and 90 days after operation (H=9.89, 55.53, 45.43, P<0.05). At 30 and 90 days after operation, the median OSDI scores were 12.50 and 10.42 in group C, respectively, which were better than those of group A scores 27.09 and 20. 8 (Z=- 6.30, -5.94, P<0.05), and were better than those of group B scores 17.71 and 13. 54 (Z=-3.40, -3.52, P<0.05). At 90 days after operation, the median BUT of B and C treatment groups was 9. 00, which was better than that of group A (4.00). The difference was statistically significant (H=21.51, P<0.05), There was no significant difference between group B and group C (Z=-0.34, P>0.05). Conclusion: The treatment of artificial tears with lipid composition in the early stage after phacoemulsification is beneficial to the improvement of postoperative symptoms and signs of dry eye.

We report the effects of treatment with canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes. Methods The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Participants in each trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6% had a history of cardiovascular disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis testing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously reported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputation (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. Conclusions In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.

Studies in children have shown that the negative prognostic impact of chemotherapy resistance is abrogated by the implementation of early response-based intensification strategies. Comparable data in adults are lacking. Patients and Methods We performed comprehensive clinicobiologic, genetic, and survival analyses of a large cohort of 213 adult patients with T-ALL, including 47 patients with ETP-ALL, treated in the GRAALL (Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) -2003 and -2005 studies. Results Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed that the genotype of immunophenotypically defined adult T-ALL is similar to the pediatric equivalent, with high rates of mutations in factors involved in cytokine receptor and RAS signaling (62.2%), hematopoietic development (29.7%), and chemical modification of histones (48.6%). In contrast to pediatric cases, mutations in DNA methylation factor genes were also common (32.4%). We found that despite expected high levels of early bone marrow chemotherapy resistance (87%), the overall prognosis for adults with ETP-ALL treated using the GRAALL protocols was not inferior to that of the non-ETP-ALL group (5-year overall survival: ETP, 59.6%; 95% CI, 44.2% to 72.0% v non-ETP, 66.5%; 95% CI, 58.7% to 73.2%; P = 0.33) and that allogeneic stem-cell transplantation had a beneficial effect in a large proportion of patients with ETP-ALL. Conclusion Our results suggest that the use of response-based risk stratification and therapy intensification abrogates the poor prognosis of adult ETP-ALL.'"

Eight hundred and twenty-eight piglets were randomly divided into three groups: group V1 was vaccinated three days before weaning, group V2 at weaning (21\xe2\x80\x85days of age) and group NV was left non-vaccinated. Vaccinations were performed using Ingelvac MycoFLEX. After the nursery period, 306 pigs were allocated to fattening unit (F1) and 501 pigs to a second unit (F2). Efficacy was evaluated using performance parameters and pneumonia lesions at slaughter. Statistically significant differences were obtained in F2 where group V1 had a higher average daily weight gain compared to groups V2 and NV for the entire study period (17 and 18\xe2\x80\x85g/day, respectively) and the fattening period (26 and 36\xe2\x80\x85g/day, respectively) (P<0.05). Considering respiratory disease scores for both fattening units, group V1 was the only group where coughing severity did not increase significantly between placement and the end of the fattening period (P>0.05). Between groups, there were no statistically significant differences for the average lung lesion scores (V1=3.44; V2=4.61; NV=4.55, P>0.05) and the prevalence of pneumonia (V1=35.0 per cent; V2=38.0 per cent; NV=41.4 per cent, P>0.05). Overall, vaccination against M hyopneumoniae before weaning provided numerically better performance than vaccination at weaning, but did not reach statistical significance. An influenza outbreak in F1 and the presence of coexisting mixed respiratory infections in both F1 and F2 could have possibly influenced the performance of both vaccinated groups across all measured parameters.'"

The trial was a prospective, controlled, randomized two-arm study evaluating the efficacy of a bioelectric dressing, Procellera\xc2\xae, applied topically two to three times per week for 2 weeks to blisters developed in Ranger trainees during training at Fort Benning, Georgia. A total of 80 US Army Ranger recruits with blister wounds below the knee were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (n = 40/group). The primary goal was to assess the clinical efficacy (rate of healing) of administered Procellera in conjunction with the standard-of-care (SOC) treatment, moleskin and Tegaderm \xc2\xae, on the healing rate of blisters compared with the SOC treatment alone. The secondary end points for efficacy were the quantities of wound fluid biomarkers and bacterial bioburden. The tertiary end point was assessment of pain in the treatment group compared with that of the control group during the 2-week study. The results showed no statistical difference between the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups in wound healing and pain. Wound fluid was reported for 24 participants (64.9%) in the SOC group and 21 participants (56.8%) in SOC+Procellera group at the baseline measurement (\xcf\x81 = .475); however, the wounds were devoid of fluid on follow-up visits. The mild nature of the wounds in this study was apparent by the low pain scores at the beginning of the study, which disappeared by the follow-up visits. The average wound sizes were 2.2cm2 and 1.5cm2 for the SOC and SOC+Procellera groups, respectively. This trial protocol should be conducted on open softtissue wounds in severe heat.

Uninterrupted oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin has become the standard of care when performing catheter-based AF ablation. Compared with warfarin, apixaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and major bleeding in nonvalvular AF. With an increase in apixaban use for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF, there is an increased interest in the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted apixaban therapy during AF ablation. We compared the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted OA therapy with either warfarin or apixaban in all patients who underwent catheter-based AF ablation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and at Augusta University Medical Center from January 7, 2013, to February 25, 2016. All patients underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram on the day of their ablation to assess for the presence of intracardiac thrombi. All complications were identified and classified as bleeding, thromboembolic events, or other. A total of 627 patients were analyzed as described earlier. There were 310 patients in the warfarin group and 317 patients in the apixaban group. There were 8 complications in the warfarin group and 5 complications in the apixaban group (p\xc2\xa0= 0.38). There were no thromboembolic complications in either group. In conclusion, the use of apixaban is as safe and effective as warfarin for uninterrupted OA therapy during catheter-based ablation of AF.'"

We compared the long-term outcomes of the 2 revascularization strategies in 1,246 patients presented with NSTE-ACS for left main or multivessel coronary artery disease. Data were pooled from the Randomized Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease (BEST) trial, the Premier of Randomized Comparison of Bypass Surgery versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients with Left Main Coronary Artery Disease (PRECOMBAT) trial, and the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 study groups. During the median follow-up of 60\xc2\xa0months, the rate of the primary outcome was significantly lower with CABG than with PCI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.98; p\xc2\xa0= 0.036). This difference was mainly attributed to a significant reduction in the rate of myocardial infarction (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82, p\xc2\xa0= 0.006). The superiority of CABG over PCI was consistent across the major subgroups. The individual risks of death from any causes or stroke were not different between the 2 groups. In contrast, the rate of repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the CABG group than in the PCI group (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.75, p <0.001). In this study, among patients with NSTE-ACS for left main or multivessel coronary artery disease, CABG significantly reduces the risk of death from any causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with PCI with drug-eluting stents.'"

To our knowledge, the effect of zinc supplementation on insulin outcomes, and potential risk of diabetes, in otherwise healthy children in the United States has not been investigated.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of zinc supplementation on insulin outcomes in black and white girls in the early stages of adolescence. A secondary objective was to determine relations between baseline zinc concentrations and insulin outcomes.Methods: Healthy black and white girls aged 9-11 y were randomly assigned to daily supplementation of zinc (9 mg elemental Zn/d; n = 75; blacks: n = 35) or placebo (n = 72; blacks: n = 32) for 4 wk. Fasting serum insulin, glucose, and C-peptide were assessed at baseline and at 4 wk. C-peptide and glucose values were used to calculate the computer model-derived homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). Changes in outcome measures were compared by using repeated-measures, mixed-model ANOVA.Results: Baseline plasma zinc was not correlated with C-peptide (r = -0.07), insulin (r = -0.06), or HOMA2-IR (r = -0.09) (all P > 0.05) after controlling for race and age.

Fifteen minutes later, participants consumed a mixed-nutrient drink (300 mL, 400 kcal, and 56 g carbohydrates) within 1 min. For the next hour (t = 0-60 min), we collected blood samples every 15 min (to measure blood glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma glucagon) and breath samples every 5 min (to measure gastric emptying via a (13)C-acetate breath test). We then quantified subjects' energy intake from a buffet-style meal (t = 60-90 min).Results: There were no differences between the 2 lysine treatments; hence, data were pooled for further analysis. Lysine did not affect blood glucose at 15 min or the blood glucose area under the curve from 0 to 60 min (AUC0-60min) but it decreased blood glucose at 60 min compared with the control solution (-9.1% \xc2\xb1 3.1%, P < 0.01). Similarly, the early insulin response and insulin AUC0-60min were not affected by lysine, but plasma insulin at 60 min was 20.9% \xc2\xb1 5.6% lower than after the control (P < 0.05). Plasma glucagon at both 15 min (20.7% \xc2\xb1 4.7%, P < 0.001) and 60 min (14.1% \xc2\xb1 5.4%, P < 0.05) and the glucagon AUC0-60min (P < 0.01) were greater after lysine than after the control. Lysine did not slow gastric emptying, and there was no effect on energy intake.Conclusion: In healthy adults, lysine slightly reduced the glycemic response to an oral mixed-macronutrient drink, an effect that was apparently independent of insulin or slowing of gastric emptying.

To activate metaboreceptive feedback, participants first performed one 120-s isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensors in the TEMP-LEG, immediately followed by postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI) via femoral blood flow occlusion. To assess central motor drive of a remote muscle group immediately following PEMI, another 120-s MVC was subsequently performed in the CL-LEG. Voluntary muscle activation (VA) was assessed using the twitch interpolation method. Perceived mental effort and limb discomfort were also recorded. In a cooled muscle, a significant increase in mean force output and mean VA (force, P < 0.001; VA, P < 0.05), as well as a significant decrease in limb discomfort (P < 0.05) occurred during the sustained MVC in the TEMP-LEG.

Methods: Clinical data of 47 patients with OA admitted at Department of Orthopaedic Surgery in Nanjing Medical University Nanjing Hospital between April and September 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, including 20 males and 27 females, aging from 57 to 77 years with mean age of (63.8\xc2\xb18.2) years. They were randomly divided into iASSIST-TKA group (23 patients) and PSI-TKA group (24 patients). The data such as hip knee ankle (HKA) angle, frontal femoral component (FFC) angle, frontal tibial component (FTC) angle, lateral femoral component (LFC) angle, lateral tibial component (LTC) angle, time of operation, post-operative wound drainage, period of hospitalization, visual analog scale (VAS) and Knee Society Score (KSS) at 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, 1 month and 3 months were recorded and compared between the two groups. T test was used to compare measurement data, Fisher exact test and \xcf\x87(2) test were applied to enumeration data in comparison among groups, and Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to ranked data. Results: The deviation values of HKA, FFC, LFC, FTC and LTC angles were all below 3\xc2\xb0(-2\xc2\xb0 to 2\xc2\xb0), and there were no significant difference between iASSIST-TKA group and PSI-TKA group (Z=-0.610 to 0.000, P=0.542 to 1.000). Compared to PSI-TKA group, the time of operation was long((80.7\xc2\xb18.8) minutes vs.(60.2\xc2\xb17.8) minutes), the amount of post-operative wound drainage was increased((210.7\xc2\xb132.1) ml vs.(185.5\xc2\xb130.2)ml) and the period of hospitalization decreased((5.4\xc2\xb12.4) d vs.(6.7\xc2\xb11.6) d) in iASSIST-TKA group, there were significant difference(t=-2.190 to 8.460, P=0.000 to 0.033). There were no significant difference in intra-operative blood drainage((18.4\xc2\xb15.4) ml vs.(17.3\xc2\xb16.2) ml) between the two groups(t=0.650, P=0.521). PSI-TKA group had a superior VAS score(4.8\xc2\xb10.6 vs. 5.5\xc2\xb10.9, 3.6\xc2\xb10.8 vs. 4.3\xc2\xb10.9), KSS clinical score(49.3\xc2\xb15.5 vs. 44.2\xc2\xb16.4, 54.9\xc2\xb14.0 vs. 50.8\xc2\xb14.2) and KSS function score(44.1\xc2\xb12.9 vs. 41.2\xc2\xb13.5, 49.6\xc2\xb13.8 vs. 46.6\xc2\xb13.2) in 1 day and 7 days post-operation(t=-3.420 to 3.150, P=0.001 to 0.007). There were no significant difference in VAS and KSS score in 14 days, 1 month and 3 months post-operation(t=-1.390 to 0.530, P=0.170 to 1.000) between the two groups. Conclusions: The iASSIST-TKA and PSI-TKA can help to make TKA procedure more accurately. iASSIST-TKA may take longer time of operation and have slower recovery, PSI-TKA may need more X-ray input and longer period of hospitalization. The long-term research of both techniques may be valuable for the further clinical usage.'"

Methods: Ten severe COPD patients with hypercapnia during acute exacerbation were examined. The baseline inspiratory pressure of PSV (PS) and the assistance level of PAV(PA) were titrated by patients\' tolerance. In addition to the baseline PS and PA, an additional decrease by 25% (PS-=75% PS, PA-=75% PA) or increase by 25% (PS+ =125% PS, PA+ =125% PA) of the assist level were applied to the patients. After the assessment of unassisted spontaneous breathing (SB), the patient was placed on the 6 levels of noninvasive-PSV and noninvasive-PAV in random sequence. Each level lasted at least 20 minutes. Respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (Vt), and respiratory work(Wex, Wip and Wv) were measured. Asynchrony index (AI) was calculated. Results: During ventilation, Vt was significantly higher with each assist level than with SB. The Vt was significant increased with PS+ than with PA+ . An increase in expiratory work(Wex) and decrease in inspiratory work(Wip) were observed respectively, with the increasing assist level. The inspiratory muscles assessed by Wip were more unloaded at PS compared with PA [PS: (1.59\xc2\xb11.27) J/min vs PA: (4.99\xc2\xb13.48) J/min P<0.01]. However, the Wex was significantly higher with PS+ than with PA+ [PS+ : (1.17\xc2\xb10.54) J/min vs PA+ : (0.49\xc2\xb10.56)J/min, P<0.01]. The AI was increased with the increasing assist level of PSV [PS-: (0.46\xc2\xb10.57)%, PS: (1.36\xc2\xb11.24)% PS+ : (5.26\xc2\xb14.77)]. No asynchrony events were observed at PA- and PA. ""Runaway"" (expiratory asynchrony) was observed during PA+ [AI: (2.62\xc2\xb12.72)%]. Conclusions: Noninvasive-PAV can increase the Vt and decrease the Wip of the COPD patients with hypercapnia and avoid the over-assistance. The ""Runaway"" will occur at assist level higher than that set by tolerance. Physiological data can monitor the patient\'s responses and the ventilator-patient interaction, which may provide objective criteria for ventilator setting.'"

Method: A multicenter, randomized and open-label trial was conducted among 229 individuals with suspected influenza which were collected from the clinic of 5 hospitals in Guangdong province (Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Shenzhen Baoan District Maternity and Child Care Service Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Dongguan Maternity and Child Care Service Centre, Yuexiu District Children's Hospital of Guangzhou) from April to July 2015. They were randomized either to oseltamivir group (oseltamivir 30-75 mg, twice daily for 5 days) or control group who were given symptom relief medicines for 5 days. Result: No significant difference was found between two groups in influenza symptoms of the patients before the treatment(P>0.05). Altogether 229 individuals (114 in oseltamivir group, 115 in control group) were analyzed for efficacy, in which 73 individuals (42 oseltamivir, 31 control), 31.9%, were identified as influenza-infected through laboratory test. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the duration of fever although shortened. In the 229 individuals , the cumulative alleviation proportion between oseltamivir and control group was not significantly different (P>0.05): the median duration of illness was 69.9 hours (95% CI 65.3-91.5) in oseltamivir group and 75.4 hours (95%CI 63.9-91. 7) in control group; the median duration of fever was 40.4 hours (95%CI 31.5-53.4) in oseltamivir group and 44.0 hours (95%CI 33.2-50.0) in control group. In the 73 individuals, the cumulative alleviation proportion between oseltamivir and control group was significantly different (P<0.05). The median duration of illness was 61.2 hours (95%CI 48.0-121. 0) in oseltamivir group, being significantly shorter than that of 116.0 hours (95%CI 91.5-175.0) in control group. But it was not significantly different that the median duration of fever was 32.8 hours (95%CI 24.0-47.0 ) in oseltamivir group and 55.8 hours (95%CI 43.6-78.3 ) in control group (P>0.05). And the median duration of fever in 60 individuals (38 oseltamivir, 22 control) was significantly different between two groups(P<0.05), who had finished a course of taking oseltamivir in the 73 individuals, 34.8 hours (95%CI 24.0-48.5 ) in oseltamivir group being significantly shorter than that of 53.3 hours (95%CI 43.6-104.0 ) in control group. There was certain difference in side effects rate between the two groups (oseltamivir 10%, control 2%, P<0.05). The main side-effects were gastrointestinal symptoms (stomachache, diarrhea, poor appetite, vomiting). Conclusion: The duration of illness and fever in suspected influenza patients treated with oseltamivir was shorter than those in the patients treated with no oseltamivir, the difference was not statistically significant, when 31.9% was confirmed with positive result of virus test in suspected influenza in children. But in these patients with positive result of virus test, the duration of illness was significantly shortened with treatment with oseltamivir as compared with no treatment with oseltamivir, and it would be better if full oseltamivir course was completed for reducing the duration of fever. Oseltamivir treatment was safe with mild side effects."""

The sample consisted of 54 occlusal carious lesions in permanent molars and premolars of 49 patients aged 8-43 years (median: 19 years). The inclusion criteria comprised the presence of a cavity with no access allowing biofilm control. The maximum depth of the lesion was the middle third of the dentin thickness, as assessed by bitewing radiography. The teeth were randomly assigned to sealant treatment (n = 28) or restorative treatment (n = 26). Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed after 1 year and after 3-4 years. The outcomes depended on the clinical performance of the sealant/restoration and the control of caries progression observed radiographically. Survival analysis was performed to assess success rates. Over the 3-4 years of monitoring, 2 sealants were totally lost, 1 needed repair, and 1 showed caries progression, totaling 4 failures in the sealant group. In the restoration group, 1 failure was observed (in need of repair). The success rates were 76% and 94% in the sealant and the restoration groups, respectively (p > 0.05). The sealing of occlusal carious lesions in permanent teeth succeeded in controlling caries over a 3-4-year period. However, sealed carious lesions require patient compliance in attending regular follow-ups to control the occurrence of clinical failures of the sealants.'"

We surveyed mothers at their baby's birth, age 6 months, and age 24 months using a validated measure of vaccine hesitancy. Both mean hesitancy scores (mean 4.1-point reduction; 95% CI, 2.5-5.6; P = .01) and the proportion of mothers who were vaccine hesitant (9.7% at baseline vs 5.9% at 24 months; P = .01) decreased significantly from child's birth to age 24 months. Changes from baseline were similar for first-time mothers and experienced mothers. Individual item analysis suggested that the decrease may have been driven by increases in maternal confidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

Forty-seven healthy subjects were included in this study: 22 randomized to telmisartan (age, 40.3\xc2\xb110.8 years; 7 women) and 25 to placebo (age, 39.3\xc2\xb19.8 years; 7 women). Tests were performed at sea level, pre- and post-treatment, during acute exposure to 3400 and 5400-m altitude (Mt. Everest Base Camp), and after 2 weeks, at 5400 m. The effects of hypobaric hypoxia on mechanical properties of large arteries were assessed by applanation tonometry, measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, analyzing arterial pulse waveforms, and evaluating subendocardial oxygen supply/demand index. No differences in hemodynamic changes during acute and prolonged exposure to 5400-m altitude were found between telmisartan and placebo groups. Aortic pulse wave velocity significantly increased with altitude (P<0.001) from 7.41\xc2\xb11.25 m/s at sea level to 7.70\xc2\xb11.13 m/s at 3400 m and to 8.52\xc2\xb11.59 m/s at arrival at 5400 m (P<0.0001), remaining elevated during prolonged exposure to this altitude (8.41\xc2\xb11.12 m/s; P<0.0001). Subendocardial oxygen supply/demand index significantly decreased with acute exposure to 3400 m: from 1.72\xc2\xb10.30 m/s at sea level to 1.41\xc2\xb10.27 m/s at 3400 m (P<0.001), remaining significantly although slightly less reduced after reaching 5400 m (1.52\xc2\xb10.33) and after prolonged exposure to this altitude (1.53\xc2\xb10.25; P<0.001). In conclusion, the acute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia induces aortic stiffening and reduction in subendocardial oxygen supply/demand index. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system does not seem to play any significant role in these hemodynamic changes.'"

However, whether it provides additional predictive information beyond traditional risk factors, including mean SBP, in the long term is unclear. The ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) was a randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; ADVANCE-ON (ADVANCE-Observational) followed-up patients subsequently. In these analyses, 9114 patients without major macrovascular or renal events or death during the first 24 months were included. Data on SBP from 6 visits during the first 24 months after randomization were used to estimate visit-to-visit variability in several ways: the primary measure was the standard deviation. Events accrued during the following 7.6 years. The primary outcome was a composite of major macrovascular and renal events and all-cause mortality. Standard deviation of SBP was log-linearly associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome (P<0.001) after adjustment for mean SBP and other cardiovascular risk factors. The hazard ratio (HR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) in the highest, compared with the lowest, tenth of the standard deviation was 1.39 (1.15-1.69). Results were similar for major macrovascular events alone and all-cause mortality alone (both P<0.01). Addition of standard deviation of SBP significantly improved 8-year risk classification (continuous net reclassification improvement, 5.3%). Results were similar for other measures of visit-to-visit variability, except maximum SBP. Visit-to-visit variability in SBP is an independent predictor of vascular complications and death, which improves risk prediction beyond that provided by traditional risk factors, including mean SBP.'"

The effect of administration of cholecalcipherol on clinical and laboratory parameters was subsequently evaluated, by a parallel, randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial. Thirty nine eRA patients and 31 age-matched controls were enrolled and compared for levels of 25OH vitamin D, T helper cell sub-types, OCs precursors including both classical and non-classical and pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline. Eligible patients were female \xe2\x89\xa518 years of age with a diagnosis of RA, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for <6 months prior to inclusion in the study. Patients with auto-immune or inflammatory diseases other than RA were excluded. Patients treated with glucocorticoids (GCs), disease modifying activity drugs and biologic agents within the past 6 months were also excluded. In the second phase of the study, eRA patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and GCs with (21) or without (18) cholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) and followed for 3 months; the randomization was done by computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Three patients didn't come back to the follow up visit for personal reasons. None of the patients experienced adverse events. The main outcome measures were T cells phenotypes, OCs precursors and inflammatory cytokines. Secondary outcome measure were clinical parameters. In eRA, 25OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower. CD4+/IFN\xce\xb3+,CD4+/IL4+, CD4+/IL17A+ and CD4+IL17A+IFN\xce\xb3+, cells were increased in eRA as well as non-classical OCs precursors, whereas T regulatory cells were not altered. TNF\xce\xb1, TGF\xce\xb21, RANKL, IL-23 and IL-6 were increased in eRA. Non-classical OCs, IL-23 and IL-6 correlated with disease severity and activity. Standard treatment with MTX and GC ameliorated clinical symptoms and reduced IL-23, whereas it did not affect CD4+ cells sub-sets nor OCs precursors. After 3 months, the combined use of cholecalcipherol significantly ameliorated the effect of treatment on global health. In eRA, a significant imbalance in T CD4+ sub-types accompanied by increased levels of non-classical OCs precursors and pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed.

Results Between August 2014 and December 2015, 669 patients were randomly assigned to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n = 446) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 223). Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly extended PFS versus fulvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P < .001). In patients with measurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% CI, 42.6% to 53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1% to 27.6%) in the control arm. The most common adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo arms were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia (46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%). Conclusions Abemaciclib at 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant was effective, significantly improving PFS and ORR and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who progressed while receiving ET.'"

The study is a large-scale, open, cluster-randomized controlled trial done in 600 villages across 5 provinces in China. Participants have either a history of stroke or an elevated risk of stroke based on age and blood pressure level at entry. Villages were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or continued usual care. Salt substitute is provided free of charge to participants in villages assigned to the intervention group. Follow-up is scheduled every 6months for 5years, and all potential endpoints are reviewed by a masked adjudication committee. The primary end point is fatal and nonfatal stroke, and the 2 secondary endpoints are total major cardiovascular events and total mortality. The study has been designed to provide 90% statistical power (with 2-sided \xce\xb1 = .05) to detect a 13% or greater relative risk reduction for stroke. The power estimate assumes a primary outcome event rate of 3.5% per year and a systolic blood pressure difference of 3.0mm Hg between randomized groups. Recruitment is complete and there are 20,996 participants (about 35 per village) that have been enrolled. Mean age is 65years and 49% are female.

IFN-\xce\xb3 production by these lymphocytes likely plays a key role in the early control of the parasite and disease severity. Analyzing human innate-like T cell and NK cell responses following infection with Plasmodium has been challenging because the early stages of infection are clinically silent. To overcome this limitation, we examined blood samples from a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study in a Tanzanian cohort, in which volunteers underwent CHMI with a low or high dose of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. The CHMI differentially affected NK, NKT (invariant NKT), and mucosal-associated invariant T cell populations in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an altered composition of this innate-like lymphocyte compartment. Although these innate-like responses are typically thought of as short-lived, we found that changes persisted for months after the infection was cleared, leading to significantly increased frequencies of mucosal-associated invariant T cells 6 mo postinfection. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR \xce\xb1\xce\xb2-chain usage analysis to define potential mechanisms for this expansion. These single-cell data suggest that this increase was mediated by homeostatic expansion-like mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that CHMI leads to previously unappreciated long-lasting alterations in the human innate-like lymphocyte compartment. We discuss the consequences of these changes for recurrent parasite infection and infection-associated pathologies and highlight the importance of considering host immunity and infection history for vaccine design.'"

A blinded, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of participants based on global gene expression profiles revealed that participants with significantly higher serum vitamin D3 levels after treatment (P\xc2\xa0= 0.007) demonstrated increased skin expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator arginase-1 (P\xc2\xa0= 0.005), and a sustained reduction in skin redness (P\xc2\xa0= 0.02), correlating with significant expression of genes related to skin barrier repair. In contrast, participants with lower serum vitamin D3 levels had significant expression of proinflammatory genes. Together the data may have broad implications for the immunotherapeutic properties of vitamin D in skin homeostasis, and implicate arginase-1 upregulation as a previously unreported mechanism by which vitamin D exerts anti-inflammatory effects in humans.'"

Patients and Methods Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, no prior gastrectomy, and \xe2\x89\xa5 two metastatic sites were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by SoC trastuzumab maintenance 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by HD trastuzumab maintenance 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until progression; treatment in each arm was combined with cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) plus capecitabine 800 mg/m(2) twice per day in cycles 1 to 6. The primary objective was HD trastuzumab OS superiority (all randomly assigned patients [full-analysis set]). Final results are from an interim analysis for futility (boundary hazard ratio [HR] \xe2\x89\xa5 0.95) at 125 deaths. Results At clinical cutoff, 248 patients had been randomly assigned. A marked increase in mean trastuzumab Ctrough was observed after the first HD trastuzumab cycle versus SoC trastuzumab. In the full-analysis set, median OS was 12.5 months in the SoC trastuzumab arm and 10.6 months in the HD trastuzumab arm (stratified HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.78; P = .2401). Results were similar in the per-protocol set (cycle 1 trastuzumab Ctrough < 12 \xc2\xb5g/mL). Safety was comparable between arms. Conclusion HD trastuzumab maintenance dosing was associated with higher trastuzumab concentrations, no increased efficacy, and no new safety signals. HELOISE confirms standard-dose trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose every 3 weeks) with chemotherapy as the SoC for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.'"

In this study, we aim to identify genes associated with childhood asthma through a multiomics ""vertical"" approach that integrates multiple analytical steps using linear and logistic regression models. In a case-control study of childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891,127), we used adjusted linear or logistic regression models to evaluate associations between several analytical steps of omics data, including genome-wide (GW) genotype data, GW methylation, GW expression profiling, cytokine levels, asthma-intermediate phenotypes, and asthma status. At each point, only the top genes/single-nucleotide polymorphisms/probes/cytokines were carried forward for subsequent analysis. In step 1, asthma modified the gene expression-protein level association for 1,645 genes; pathway analysis showed an enrichment of these genes in the cytokine signaling system (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89269 genes). In steps 2-3, expression levels of 40 genes were associated with intermediate phenotypes (asthma onset age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, exacerbations, eosinophil counts, and skin test reactivity); of those, methylation of seven genes was also associated with asthma. Of these seven candidate genes, IL5RA was also significant in analytical steps 4-8. We then measured plasma IL-5 receptor \xce\xb1 levels, which were associated with asthma age of onset and moderate-severe exacerbations. In addition, in silico database analysis showed that several of our identified IL5RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with transcription factors related to asthma and atopy. This approach integrates several analytical steps and is able to identify biologically relevant asthma-related genes, such as IL5RA. It differs from other methods that rely on complex statistical models with various assumptions.'"

It was demonstrated that using temporary bypass grafting in cases of isolated assessment of the parameters of cerebral oxygenation and retrograde pressure increased the frequency of the development of shunt-related ischaemic complications as compared with the patients in whom shunts were not used due to lack of a synchronous decrease in these parameters (13.5 vs 1.5%, respectively; OR 10.0; 95% CI 1.1-82.2; p=0.039). The findings of the carried out retrospective analysis suggested that the main predictor of the development of the outcome 'stroke + transitory ischaemic attack' was the use of a temporary internal shunt during the main stage of the operation (p<0.00001)."""

Research has recently uncovered the potential negative effects of depression help-seeking messages if depressed cognition is not considered in the health message design process. It is unclear if depression determines whether and how individuals pay attention to gain- and loss-framed depression help-seeking messages-a mechanism that has significant implications for the strategic planning of health communication interventions. In order to enable the effective matching of message design and audience features, this study investigated attention patterns for gain (n = 75)- and loss (n = 78)-framed depression help-seeking messages using eye-tracking technology and self-report measures. The results confirmed that depression is a characteristic of risk avoidance and negative cognition. Depressed participants tended to pay more attention to disease information that was placed in a loss-framed rather than a gain-framed depression help-seeking message. Using negative message framing strategies for health messages seeking to educate about depression symptoms might therefore be a useful persuasive strategy-particularly when disseminated to vulnerable populations affected by depression.

We conducted a nested case-control study including 127 noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (NCGA), 41 esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma and 60 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incident cases identified within ATBC. Controls were matched to cases on age, date of serum collection and follow-up time. One-carbon nutrient concentrations were measured in fasting serum samples collected at baseline (up to 17 years prior to cancer diagnosis). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Lower prediagnostic vitamin B12 concentrations at baseline were associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of NCGA (95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.7-12.6 for lowest compared to highest quartile, p-trend <0.001). This association remained in participants who developed cancer more than 10 years after blood collection, and after restricting the analysis to participants with clinically normal serum vitamin B12 (>300 pmol/L). In contrast, pepsinogen I, a known serologic marker of gastric atrophy, was not associated with NCGA in this population. As vitamin B12 absorption requires intact gastric mucosa to produce acid and intrinsic factor, our findings suggest vitamin B12 as a possible serologic marker for the atrophic gastritis that precedes NCGA, one more strongly associated with subsequent NCGA than pepsinogen.'"

However, quantitative data on the impact of cash transfer programs on children's energy and nutrient intakes are lacking.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of seasonal unconditional cash transfers on children's energy, micro- and macronutrient, and food group intakes during the lean season in Burkina Faso.Methods: Within the framework of the MAM'Out (Moderate Acute Malnutrition Out) cluster-randomized controlled trial, two 24-h dietary recall surveys were conducted in July and August 2014. Daily energy and macro- and micronutrient intakes, breastfeeding practices, and food group consumption were analyzed for 322 children aged 14-27 mo from an intervention group (benefiting from unconditional cash transfer during the lean season in 2013 and 2014) and a control group by using mixed linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models or a \xce\xb3-generalized linear model with log-link.

No difference was found in energy intake between the 2 groups. The minimum dietary diversity of two-thirds of the children who benefited from cash transfers was adequate compared with only one-third in the control group (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Unconditional seasonal cash transfer increases intakes of high-nutritional-value foods in Burkinabe children aged 14-27 mo.

We recruited 166 participants aged \xe2\x89\xa565 y. Participants were stratified on body mass index, sex, and age and assigned to receive either a MedDiet or a habitual diet (HabDiet). The primary outcome was cognitive function, reported elsewhere. As secondary outcomes, assessment of fasting total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triglycerides (TGs); glucose; insulin; hs-CRP; and F2-IsoPs was completed at baseline and at 3 and 6 mo. The MedDiet group followed a prescribed diet containing 15-45 mL extra-virgin olive oil/d, abundant vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, and whole grains, as well as moderate fish, poultry, and dairy foods. Dietary intake was measured by 3-d weighed food records at baseline and at 2 and 4 mo.

Data from 2 randomized studies were combined [50 healthy participants; 25 men, mean \xc2\xb1 SD age: 23 \xc2\xb1 2.8 y; mean \xc2\xb1 SD body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.4 \xc2\xb1 1.7].

The effect of LEs on (13)CO2 excretion profiles was determined. The BT half-emptying times (BT T50) were validated with the MRI half-emptying time of the ingested fat volume (MRI T50).Results: The effect of LEs on (13)CO2 excretion depended on the properties of the (13)C marker. T50 for OCC was shorter by 98 min for LE1 than for LE4 (P < 0.001). Other markers showed either no LE dependency or a longer T50 for LE1 than for LE4. No difference in T50 between OCC and ACC was detected in LE1. In LE4, the T50 was longer by 154 min (P < 0.0001). There was some concordance between MRI T50 and OCC BT T50 for LE1 (rc = 0.7). No other marker showed any concordance with fat GE. (13)C-Nuclear magnetic resonance in vitro findings were compatible with changes in the kinetics of phase transfer of OCC dependent on its protonation state.Conclusions: The structure of fat present in the stomach affects (13)CO2 excretion. The chemical properties of the (13)C marker and their gastric and postgastric interaction with fat renders (13)CO2 excretion an inappropriate measure of LE emptying in healthy adults.

Understanding this heterogeneity, however, is a necessary step toward personalizing antihypertensive therapy. We applied trajectory-based modeling to data on 39\xe2\x80\x89763 study participants of the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) to identify distinct patterns of systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to randomized medications during the first 6 months of the trial. Two trajectory patterns were identified: immediate responders (85.5%), on average, had a decreasing SBP, whereas nonimmediate responders (14.5%), on average, had an initially increasing SBP followed by a decrease. Compared with those randomized to chlorthalidone, participants randomized to amlodipine (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.31), lisinopril (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.73-2.03), and doxazosin (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.52-1.78) had higher adjusted odds ratios associated with being a nonimmediate responder (versus immediate responder). After multivariable adjustment, nonimmediate responders had a higher hazard ratio of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.21-1.84), combined cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31), and heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.24-1.78) during follow-up between 6 months and 2 years. The SBP response trajectories provided superior discrimination for predicting downstream adverse cardiovascular events than classification based on difference in SBP between the first 2 measurements, SBP at 6 months, and average SBP during the first 6 months. Our findings demonstrate heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive therapies and show that chlorthalidone is associated with more favorable initial response than the other medications.'"

In all, fifty-four subjects completed a double-blind randomised controlled intervention study. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive high-quality FO (n 17), oxidised FO (n 18) or high-oleic sunflower oil capsules (HOSO, n 19) for 7 weeks. The concentration of marine n-3 fatty acids was equal in high-quality FO and oxidised FO (1\xc2\xb76 g EPA+DHA/d). The peroxide value (PV) and anisidine value (AV) were 4 mEq/kg and 3 in high-quality FO and HOSO, whereas the PV and AV in the oxidised FO were 18 mEq/kg and 9. Blood samples were collected at baseline and end of study. NMR spectroscopy was applied for the analysis of lipoprotein subclasses and their lipid concentrations. High-quality FO reduced the concentration of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles and large, medium and small LDL particles, as well as the concentrations of total lipids, phospholipids, total cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol in IDL and LDL subclasses compared with oxidised FO and HOSO. Hence, high-quality FO and oxidised FO differently affect lipid composition in lipoprotein subclasses, with a more favourable effect mediated by high-quality FO.

Fasting assessments, a high-fat meal test (HFM) and microbiota analyses were used to assess the intervention effects.

No significant differences in the inflammatory response to the HFM were observed after probiotic yogurt compared with acidified milk intake; however, both products were associated with significant reductions in the inflammatory response to the HFM compared with the baseline tests (assessed by IL6, TNF\xce\xb1 and chemokine ligand 5) (P<0\xc2\xb7001). These observations were accompanied by significant changes in microbiota taxa, including decreased abundance of Bilophila wadsworthia after acidified milk (log 2-fold-change (FC)=-1\xc2\xb75, P adj=0\xc2\xb705) and probiotic yogurt intake (FC=-1\xc2\xb73, P adj=0\xc2\xb703), increased abundance of Bifidobacterium species after acidified milk intake (FC=1\xc2\xb74, P adj=0\xc2\xb704) and detection of Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus (FC=7\xc2\xb70, P adj<0\xc2\xb701) and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus (FC=6\xc2\xb70, P adj<0\xc2\xb701) after probiotic yogurt intake.

Methods: Subjects (n=43; ears=75 )were recruited during June 2015 to October 2016 from the out-patients of our hospital. These patients had chronic (longer than 6months) and idiopathic tinnitus, with or without significant sensorineural hearing loss. In the prospective design, the patients were randomly divided into group A (treated with tailor-made notched music) and group B (treated with analogous sound masking), and received the treatment for 3 months. The tinnitus scale, tinnitus questionnaire and audiological findings were evaluated before treatment, and at one month and three months after treatment started. Results: After onemonth of treatment, the effective rate between the two groups was 40.9% and 42.9%, there was no significant difference between the two groups (\xcf\x87(2)= 0.017, P=0.897). The average VAS for patients in group A showed more decrease in group A than in group B(VAS: 1.8 vs. 0.8, the percentage : 29.5% vs. 13.6%), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (t=-1.450, P=0.155). After 3 months of treatment, the effective rates were 68.2% and 23.8%, respectively. There was significant difference between the two groups (\xcf\x87(2)= 8.503, P=0.004). The difference of the VAS scores between the two groups was statistically significant (t=-3.263, P=0.002), and the VAS score of group A was less.After 3 months of treatment, there was significant decreaseinthe average tinnitus loudness for patients in group A(t=5.569, P<0.01), and there was no significant changein group B(t=-0.953, P=0.374).

The study included 140 perimenopausal women subjected to urodynamic tests at the Department of Gynaecology, Endocrinology and Gynaecologic Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Police (Poland) in 2013-2015. The study subjects were divided into two groups, A and B. Each patient completed two questionnaires, an original survey developed by the authors and the validated ICIQ LUTS QoL. Two exercise programs, each lasting for 3 months and consisting of 4 weekly sessions, were recommended to the study subjects. The program for Group A included exercises for pelvic floor muscles (PFM) with simultaneous tension of the transverse abdominal muscle (TrA), and the program for Group B, PFM exercises without TrA tension. After completing the exercise programs, patients with stage 1 SUI, both from Group A and from Group B, showed a significant improvement in most QoL domains measured with ICIQ LUTS QoL.

However, there is little published evidence on the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban for AF in patients with active cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with active cancer and AF. The use of rivaroxaban in patients with cancer at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is monitored in the setting of a Quality Assessment Initiative. Patients with active cancer and AF, treated with rivaroxaban from January 1, 2014, to March 31, 2016, are included in this analysis. Clinical end points were defined a priori and assessed through text searches of medical records. A total of 163 evaluable patients were identified. After adjusting for competing risks, the estimated 1-year cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.4% (95% CI 0% to 3.4%) and major bleeding was 1.2% (95% CI 0% to 2.9%). The risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding leading to discontinuation of anticoagulation at 1\xc2\xa0year was 14.0% (95% CI 4.2% to 22.7%). The cumulative incidence of mortality was 22.6% (95% CI 12.2% to 31.7%) at 1 year, reflecting an active cancer population. One patient died after developing an acute ischemic cerebrovascular insult. In conclusion, the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban treatment for nonvalvular AF in patients with active cancer is comparable to the results of the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) study in the general population.'"

Methods: A total of 251 consecutive STEMI patients underwent PPCI in the heart center of Tianjin Third Central Hospital from January 2012 to June 2014 were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, control, single-blinded, clinical registry study. Patients were randomly divided into IPC group (123 cases) and control group (128 cases) with random number table. Patients in IPC group underwent three times of inflation/deflation with low inflation pressure using a balloon catheter within one minute after culprit vessel blood recovery, and then treated by PPCI. Patients in control group received PPCI procedure directly. The basic clinical characteristics, incidence of reperfusion arrhythmia during the procedure, the rate of electrocardiogram ST-segment decline, peak value of myocardial necrosis markers, incidence of contrast induced acute kidney injury(CI-AKI), and one-year major adverse cardiovascular events(MACE) which including myocardial infarction again, malignant arrhythmia, rehospitalization for heart failure, repeat revascularization, stroke, and death after the procedure were analyzed between the two groups. Results: The age of IPC group and control group were comparable((61.2\xc2\xb112.6) vs. (64.2\xc2\xb112.1) years old, P=0.768). The incidence of reperfusion arrhythmia during the procedure was significantly lower in the IPC group than in the control group(42.28% (52/123) vs. 57.03% (73/128), P=0.023). The rate of electrocardiogram ST-segment decline immediately after the procedure was significantly higher in the IPC group than in the control group (77.24% (95/123) vs. 64.84% (83/128), P=0.037). The peak value of myocardial necrosis markers after the procedure were significantly lower in the IPC group than in the control group(creatine kinase: 1 257 (682, 2 202) U/L vs. 1 737(794, 2 816)U/L, P=0.029; creatine kinase-MB: 123(75, 218)U/L vs.165(95, 288)U/L, P=0.010). The rate of CI-AKI after the procedure was significantly lower in the IPC group than in the control group(5.69%(7/123) vs. 14.06%(18/128), P=0.034). The rate of the one-year MACE was significantly lower in the IPC group than in the control group(7.32%(9/123) vs. 15.63% (20/128), P=0.040). Conclusion: The IPC strategy performed eight before PPCI can reduce myocardial ischemia- reperfusion injury, decline the rates of CI-AKI and one-year MACE significantly in STEMI patients, thus has a significant protective effect on heart and kidney in STEMI patients.

In this study, we investigated whether novices are able to tap with one hand by matching different rates of a metronome while sawing with the other hand. This experiment was based on the assumption that saw movement is controlled consistently at a predictable rate without the need for paying primary attention to it. It would follow that consciously matching different stipulated metronome rates with the other hand would result in the spontaneous performance of polyrhythms. Six experimental conditions were randomised: single handed tapping and sawing as well as four bimanual conditions with expected ratios of 1:1 (performed with and without matching a metronome) as well as 3:4 and 4:3 (performed matching a metronome). Results showed that participants executed the saw movement at a consistent cycle duration of 0.44 [0.20] s to 0.51 [0.19] s across single and bimanual conditions, with no significant effect of the condition on the cycle duration (p = 0.315). Similarly, free tapping was executed at a cycle duration of 0.48 [0.22] s. In the bimanual conditions, we found that for a ratio of 4:3 (4 taps against 3 sawing cycles per measure), the observed and predicted ratio of 0.75 were not significantly different (p = 0.369), supporting our hypothesis of the spontaneous adoption of polyrhythms. However, for a ratio of 3:4 (3 taps against 4 sawing cycles per measure), the observed and predicted ratio differed (p = 0.016), with a trend towards synchronisation. Our findings show that bimanual independence when performing complex polyrhythms can in principle be achieved if the movement of one hand can be performed without paying much-if any-attention to it. In this paradigm, small rhythmic arm movements are possibly driven by an intrinsic timing which leads to spontaneous convergence on a cycle duration of around 0.5 s, while the movement of the other hand can be controlled consciously to occur at desired rates.'"

Personalized maternal counseling may improve childbirth outcomes, growth, and health. We assessed the effectiveness of facility-based personalized maternal nutrition counseling (from pregnancy to 18 months after birth) in improving child growth and health in rural Burkina Faso. We conducted a paired cluster randomized controlled trial in a rural district of Burkina Faso with 12 primary health centers (clusters). Healthcare providers in the intervention centers received patient-centered communication and nutrition counseling training. Pregnant women in the third trimester living in the center catchment areas and intending to stay for the next 2 years were prospectively included. We followed 2253 mother-child pairs quarterly until the child was aged 18 months. Women were interviewed about counseling experiences, dietary practices during pregnancy, and their child's feeding practices and morbidity history. Anthropometric measurements were taken at each visit using standardized methods. The primary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of wasting, and changes in child weight-for-height z-score (WHZ). Secondary outcomes were the women's prenatal dietary practices, early breastfeeding practices, exclusive breastfeeding, timely introduction of complementary food, child's feeding frequency and dietary diversity, children's mean birth weight, endpoint prevalence of stunting, and cumulative incidence of diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infection. All analyses were by intention-to-treat using mixed effects models. The intervention and control arms each included six health centers. Mothers in the intervention arm had a significantly higher exposure to counseling with 11.2% for breastfeeding techniques to 75.7% for counseling on exclusive breastfeeding. Mothers of infants below 6 months of age in the intervention arm were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (54.3% vs 42.3%; Difference of Proportion (DP) 12.8%; 95% CI: 2.1, 23.6; p = 0.020) as compared to the control arm. Between 6 and 18 months of age, more children in the intervention arm benefited from the required feeding frequency (68.8% vs 53.4%; DP 14.1%; 95% CI: 9.0, 19.2; p<0.001) and a larger proportion had a minimum dietary diversity (28.6% vs 22.0%; DP 5.9%; 95% CI: 2.7, 9.2; p<0.001). Birth weight of newborns in the intervention arm was on average 84.8 g (p = 0.037) larger compared to the control arm. However, we found no significant differences in child anthropometry or morbidity between study arms. Facility-based personalized maternal nutrition counseling was associated with an improved prenatal dietary practices, Infant and Young Child Feeding practices, and child birth weight. Complementary strategies are warranted to obtain meaningful impact on child growth and morbidity. This includes strategies to ensure good coverage of facility-based services and effective nutrition/care practices in early childhood."""

These children are vulnerable to physical, sexual and emotional abuse, and neglect. However, CCPs make less than 1% of all reports of suspected child abuse and neglect that are made to child protective services. CCPs are therefore an untapped resource in the public health response to child maltreatment. However, their knowledge and attitudes about duties to report child maltreatment are poorly understood. Moreover, no rigorous research has tested whether their knowledge and attitudes about reporting child maltreatment can be improved. These gaps in knowledge are important because knowledge of the duty and positive attitudes towards it produce more effective reporting, and little evidence exists about how to enhance cognitive and affective attributes. Using the CONSORT approach, we report a single-blind test-retest randomized controlled trial evaluating iLook Out for Child Abuse, a customized online educational intervention for CCPs to increase knowledge and attitudes towards the reporting duty. 762 participants were randomized with results analyzed for 741 participants (372 in the intervention group; 369 in the control).

Risk factors for SND were determined by logistic regression.Ninety-seven patients with PVO-associated SND cases, and 297 controls were included. Risk factors for SND were epidural abscess [adjusted odds ratio, aOR 8.9 (3.8-21)], cervical [aOR 8.2 (2.8-24)], and/or thoracic involvement [aOR 14.8 (5.6-39)], Staphylococcus aureus PVO [aOR 2.5 (1.1-5.3)], and C-reactive protein (CRP) >150\xe2\x80\x8amg/L [aOR 4.1 (1.9-9)].

No factor was found significantly associated with good outcome, whereas high Charlson index [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) 0.3 (0.1-0.9)], low American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale at diagnosis [aHR 0.4 (0.2-0.9)], and thoracic spinal cord compression [aHR 0.2 (0.08-0.5)] were associated with poor outcome. Duration of antibiotic treatment was not associated with functional outcome.SND is more common in cervical, thoracic, and S. aureus PVO, in the presence of epidural abscess, and when CRP >150\xe2\x80\x8amg/L.

Research tends to focus on antioxidants, flavonoids and polyphenols contained in FV as the main beneficial components to health; however, increasing FV may also alter overall diet profile. Extra FV may be substituted for foods thought to be less healthy, therefore altering the overall macronutrient and/or micronutrient content in the diet. This analysis merged dietary data from four intervention studies in participants with varying health conditions and examined the effect of increased FV consumption on diet profile. Dietary intake was assessed by either diet diaries or diet histories used in four FV randomised intervention studies. All food and drink intake recorded was analysed using WISP version 3.0, and FV portions were manually counted using household measures. Regression analysis revealed significant increases in intakes of energy (172 kJ (+41 kcal)), carbohydrate (+3\xc2\xb79 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), total sugars (+6\xc2\xb70 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and fibre (+0\xc2\xb78 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and significant decreases in intakes of total fat (-1\xc2\xb74 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), SFA (-0\xc2\xb76 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), MUFA (-0\xc2\xb76 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), PUFA (-0\xc2\xb71 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) and starch (-2\xc2\xb71 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) per one portion increase in FV. Significant percentage increases were also observed in vitamin C (+24 %) and -carotene (+20 %) intake, per one portion increase in FV. In conclusion, pooled analysis of four FV intervention studies, that used similar approaches to achieving dietary change, in participants with varying health conditions, demonstrated an increase in energy, total carbohydrate, sugars and fibre intake, and a decrease in fat intake alongside an expected increase in micronutrient intake.'"

However, co-infection with other respiratory pathogens often results in a larger effect on production, sometimes with clinical signs. Little is known about the impact of a moderate level PCV2 infection without co-infections, particularly in terms of feed conversion ratio and antimicrobial consumption. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of vaccination against PCV2 in a sub-clinically infected, high-health finishing herd in terms of viral load in serum, feed conversion ratio and antimicrobial treatments. The study was conducted as a randomised clinical field trial with a parallel group design. Vaccination against PCV2 significantly (p<0.001) reduced the prevalence of PCV2-positive serum pools, from 91% in the control group to 6% in the vaccinated group, as well as the viral load for positive pools from 5.79 to 3.99 log(10) copies per ml serum. Despite this, feed conversion ratio for the two groups were not significantly different with an average of 2.75 and 2.76 feeding units/kg gain for vaccinated and control pigs, respectively (p=0.598). The proportion of pigs treated by injection with an antimicrobial was lower in the vaccinated group (4.4%) compared to the non-vaccinated group (5.6%), but the difference was not significant (p=0.125). In conclusion, in this herd without respiratory co-infections and with moderate viral loads of PCV2, vaccination significantly reduced the prevalence and viral load of PCV2-positive pigs, but had no significant impact on feed conversion ratio or antimicrobial consumption.'"

These results were verified in a subset of the placebo group that switched to metformin 6 months after the start of the trial. Transfer of fecal samples (obtained before and 4 months after treatment) from metformin-treated donors to germ-free mice showed that glucose tolerance was improved in mice that received metformin-altered microbiota. By directly investigating metformin-microbiota interactions in a gut simulator, we showed that metformin affected pathways with common biological functions in species from two different phyla, and many of the metformin-regulated genes in these species encoded metalloproteins or metal transporters.

Patients and Methods Overall, 452 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from two prospective, randomized DLBCL trials (RICOVER-60, prospective, randomized study for patients > 60 years, all IPI groups; and R-MegaCHOEP, prospective, randomized study for patients \xe2\x89\xa4 60 years with age-adjusted IPI 2,3) of the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group were analyzed with the Lymph2Cx assay for COO classification, with immunohistochemistry for MYC and BCL2, and with fluorescent in situ hybridization for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements. Results COO classification was successful in 414 of 452 samples. No significant differences with respect to COO (activated B-cell [ABC]-like DLBCL v germinal center B-cell [GCB]-like DLBCL) were observed in event-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in the RICOVER-60 trial. Also, no differences with respect to COO were observed in multivariable analyses adjusted for International Prognostic Index factors in event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] of ABC-like disease v GCB-like disease, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6; P = .93), progression-free survival (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P = .82), and overall survival (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P = .96). Similar results were observed in the R-MegaCHOEP trial. In patients treated with R-CHOP, DE status was associated with significantly inferior survival compared with nonDE within the GCB, but not within the ABC subgroup. DE status was associated with significantly inferior outcome compared with patients with ABC-like DLBCL without DE (5-year PFS rate, 39% [95% CI,19% to 59%] v 68% [95% CI, 52% to 85%]; P = .03) and compared with patients with GCB-like DLBCL without DE. When data from patients with nonDE were analyzed separately, the outcome of patients in the ABC subgroup was inferior to that of patients in the GCB subgroup (5-year PFS rate, 68% [95% CI, 52% to 85%] v 85% [95% CI, 74% to 96%]; P = .04). Conclusion COO profiling in two prospective randomized DLBCL trials failed to identify prognostic subgroups, whereas dual expression of MYC and BCL2 was predictive of poor survival. Evaluation of prognostic or predictive biomarkers in the management of DLBCL, such as the COO, within prospective clinical trials will be important in the future.'"

The setting was 22 dental practices in Northern Ireland. Participants were centrally randomized into intervention (22,600 ppm fluoride varnish, toothbrush, a 50-mL tube of 1,450 ppm fluoride toothpaste, and standardized prevention advice) and control (advice only), both provided at 6-monthly intervals during a 3-y follow-up. The primary outcome measure was conversion from caries-free to caries-active states assessed by calibrated and blinded examiners; secondary outcome measures included decayed, missing, or filled teeth surfaces (dmfs); pain; and extraction. Cumulative costs were related to each of the trial's outcomes in a series of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of using dentist's time as measured by observation rather than that reported by the dentist. The costs of applying topical fluoride were also estimated assuming the work was undertaken by dental nurses or hygienists rather than dentists. A total of 1,248 children (624 randomized to each group) were recruited, and 1,096 (549 in the intervention group and 547 in the control group) were included in the final analyses. The mean difference in direct health care costs between groups was \xc2\xa3107.53 (\xc2\xa3155.74 intervention, \xc2\xa348.21 control, P < 0.05) per child. When all health care costs were compared, the intervention group's mean cost was \xc2\xa3212.56 more than the control group (\xc2\xa3987.53 intervention, \xc2\xa3774.97 control, P < 0.05). Statistically significant differences in outcomes were only detected with respect to carious surfaces. The mean cost per carious surface avoided was estimated at \xc2\xa3251 (95% confidence interval, \xc2\xa3454.39-\xc2\xa379.52). Sensitivity analyses did not materially affect the study's findings. This trial raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of a fluoride-based intervention delivered at the practice level in the context of a state-funded dental service (EudraCT No: 2009-010725-39; ISRCTN: ISRCTN36180119)."""

All arms included iron (60 mg/d) and folic acid (400 \xce\xbcg/d). The MMN and PE+MMN arms included 30 mg supplemental Zn/d. In a subgroup of \xe2\x88\xbc300 mother-infant pairs, we measured maternal iron status, mRNA levels of genes encoding for placental iron and zinc transport proteins, and cord blood iron levels.Results: Maternal plasma iron concentration in late pregnancy was 45% and 78% lower in the PE and PE+MMN groups compared to the FeFol and MMN groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The mRNA levels of the placental iron uptake protein transferrin receptor 1 were 30-49% higher in the PE and PE+MMN arms than in the FeFol arm (P < 0.031), and also higher in the PE+MMN arm (29%; P = 0.042) than in the MMN arm. Ferritin in infant cord blood was 18-22% lower in the LNS groups (P < 0.024). Zinc supplementation in the MMN arm was associated with higher maternal plasma zinc concentrations (10% increase; P < 0.001) than in other intervention arms. mRNA levels for intracellular zinc-uptake proteins, in this case zrt, irt-like protein (ZIP) 4 and ZIP8, were 96-205% lower in the PE+MMN arm than in the intervention arms without added zinc (P < 0.025). Furthermore, mRNA expression of ZIP1 was 85% lower in the PE+MMN group than in the PE group (P = 0.003).Conclusion: In conditions of low maternal iron and in the absence of supplemental zinc, the placenta upregulates the gene expression of iron and zinc uptake proteins, presumably in order to meet fetal demands in the face of low maternal supply.

The 8.3-y intervention period ended in March 2005, after which >80% of surviving participants consented to additional active follow-up through September 2010; all participants were followed for mortality through 2013. Breast and colorectal cancer were the primary trial outcomes, and coronary heart disease (CHD) and overall CVD were additional designated outcomes.Results: Incidence rates for CHD and total CVD did not differ between the intervention and comparison groups in either the intervention or postintervention period. However, CHD HRs comparing these groups varied strongly with baseline CVD and hypertension status. Participants without prior CVD had an intervention period CHD HR of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.87) or 1.04 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.19) if they were normotensive or hypertensive, respectively (P-interaction = 0.003). The CHD benefit among healthy normotensive women was partially offset by an increase in ischemic stroke risk. Corresponding HRs in the postintervention period were close to null. Participants with CVD at baseline (3.4%) had CHD HRs of 1.47 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.93) and 1.61 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.55) in the intervention and postintervention periods, respectively. However, various lines of evidence suggest that results in women with CVD or hypertension at baseline are confounded by postrandomization use of cholesterol-lowering medications.Conclusions: CVD risk in postmenopausal women appears to be sensitive to a change to a low-fat dietary pattern and, among healthy women, includes both CHD benefit and stroke risk.

Lactating mothers drank vegetable, beet, celery, and carrot juices for 1 mo beginning at 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mo postpartum or for 3 mo beginning at 0.5 mo postpartum. The control group drank equal volumes of water and avoided drinking the juices. Mothers rated the tastes of the juices and self-reported dietary intakes at each monthly visit (0.5-4.5 mo). After weaning, when 7.9 mo of age, infants' acceptance of plain, carrot-flavor (exposed flavor), and broccoli-flavor (nonexposed flavor) cereals was assessed on separate days.Results: The timing of exposure affected the acceptance of the carrot flavor that did not generalize to the novel broccoli flavor. A relatively brief experience (1 mo) with vegetable flavors in mothers' milk, starting at 0.5 mo postpartum, was sufficient to shift the hedonic tone, which resulted in a faster rate of eating carrot-flavored cereal than that in infants who were exposed during subsequent months or not at all. One month of exposure had a greater effect than 3 mo of exposure or no exposure. Regardless of when exposure occurred, infants were less likely to display facial expressions of distaste initially when eating the carrot cereal. Over time, mothers liked the tastes of carrot, beet, and celery juices more, but no changes in dietary intake of vegetables were observed.Conclusions: Early life may be an optimum time for both infants and their mothers to learn to like the taste of healthy foods. More research is needed to facilitate the liking and eating of these foods by mothers, which will, in turn, increase the likelihood of their feeding these foods to their children.

Thirty-five participants were randomized and asked to rinse twice daily with 15 ml of an alcohol-containing 0.12% chlorhexidine solution, an alcohol-free 0.12% chlorhexidine solution, or placebo. The study was conducted in three experimental periods of 4 days each, with a 10-day washout between the periods. All the experimental periods followed the same protocol, except that the solutions were switched. Biofilm distribution was evaluated every 24 hours by the Plaque-Free Zone Index, during 96 hours. Adverse events were self-reported and sensory evaluation was performed using a hedonic scale. Compared to the placebo, the chlorhexidine solutions resulted in a significantly higher number of surfaces free of plaque over 96 hours (p < 0.01), and were able to prevent subgingival biofilm formation (p < 0.01). The alcohol-free chlorhexidine solution was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events, compared with alcohol-containing chlorhexidine (p < 0.05); it also received better sensory evaluation and acceptance by trial participants, compared with the alcohol-containing chlorhexidine (p = 0.007), and had a similar inhibitory effect on the formation of supra- and subgingival biofilms.'"

There is currently no known cure, and pharmacological interventions are usually targeting symptomatic relief, where natural and herbal remedies also play a role. This study aimed to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of IQP-CL-101 in symptomatic IBS relief. A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted over 8\xc2\xa0weeks. A total of 99 subjects fulfilling ROME-III criteria for IBS were randomised into two groups, given either two IQP-CL-101 softgels or matching placebo twice daily before main meals. The primary endpoint was the difference in change of IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) after an 8-week intake of IQP-CL-101 compared to placebo. After 8\xc2\xa0weeks, subjects on IQP-CL-101 showed a significant reduction in IBS-SSS (113.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa064.9-point reduction) compared to subjects on placebo (38.7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa064.5-point reduction) (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.001). A significant improvement could be seen as early as 4\xc2\xa0weeks. No serious adverse events were reported throughout.

In animal studies, this side effect arises from ETB receptor blockade in the renal tubule. Previous attempts to determine whether this mechanism operates in humans have been confounded by the hemodynamic consequences of ET receptor stimulation/blockade. We aimed to determine the effects of ET signaling on salt transport in the human nephron by administering subpressor doses of the ET-1 precursor, big ET-1. We conducted a 2-phase randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers. After sodium restriction, subjects received either intravenous placebo or big ET-1, in escalating dose (\xe2\x89\xa4300 pmol/min). This increased plasma concentration and urinary excretion of ET-1. Big ET-1 reduced heart rate (\xe2\x89\x888 beats/min) but did not otherwise affect systemic hemodynamics or glomerular filtration rate. Big ET-1 increased the fractional excretion of sodium (from 0.5 to 1.0%). It also increased free water clearance and tended to increase the abundance of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) in urinary extracellular vesicles. Our protocol induced modest increases in circulating and urinary ET-1. Sodium and water excretion increased in the absence of significant hemodynamic perturbation, supporting a direct action of ET-1 on the renal tubule. Our data also suggest that sodium reabsorption is stimulated by ET-1 in the thick ascending limb and suppressed in the distal renal tubule. Fluid retention associated with ET receptor antagonist therapy may be circumvented by coprescribing potassium-sparing diuretics.'"

The strongest evidence supporting the cardiovascular benefit of statins in individuals with CKD was shown with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus placebo.

Therefore, we estimated GFR in 18,015 individuals from the IMPROVE-IT (ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone in individuals with cardiovascular disease and creatinine clearance >30 ml/min) and examined post hoc the relationship of eGFR with end points across treatment arms. For the primary end point of cardiovascular death, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke, the relative risk reduction of combination therapy compared with monotherapy differed by eGFR (P=0.04). The difference in treatment effect was observed at eGFR\xe2\x89\xa475 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and most apparent at levels \xe2\x89\xa460 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) Compared with individuals receiving monotherapy, individuals receiving combination therapy with a baseline eGFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) experienced a 12% risk reduction (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.82 to 0.95); those with a baseline eGFR of 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had a 13% risk reduction (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.98). In stabilized individuals within 10 days of acute coronary syndrome, combination therapy seemed to be more effective than monotherapy in individuals with moderately reduced eGFR (30-60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)).

Phone operators in emergency medical dispatch centers are particularly at risk. We aimed to demonstrate that the most stressful time for emergency medical dispatchers is the shift when they receive emergency incoming calls, with cortisol as a biomarker of stress. For each emergency medical dispatcher, we measured outcomes over a control day and during three types of shift: Incoming emergency call, Dispatch and Re-assessment. The pattern of shifts was randomized. Saliva was sampled every 15 minutes for 2 hours, i.e. 6 consecutive times, starting 15 minutes after the first life-and-death incoming emergency call between 2 and 5 pm during three types of shift. We measured saliva cortisol every 2 hours over a control day, from 7am to 9pm. Perceived stress was assessed by a visual analog scale. We recruited 22 phone operators aged 36.4+/-10.8 years old (14 women and 8 men). Cortisol values were higher during the Incoming emergency call shift than during the Dispatch (p = .04) and Re-assessment (p = .04) shifts. The increase in cortisol levels was greater in men than in women (p = .009). There were no differences between control values and those of the three shifts. The kinetics of cortisol increased with greater perceived stress overall (p < .001) and for each type of shift (Incoming emergency call, p = .02; Dispatch p = .03; Re-assessment: p < .001). The kinetics of cortisol in response to incoming emergency calls was greater when the call was an absolute emergency (p = .03), and also tended to further increase when a subsequent absolute incoming emergency call was received (p = 0.07). In conclusion, the incoming emergency call shift carries particular risk for dispatchers, who have greater perceived stress and a greater increase in cortisol levels.'"

Background Evidence suggests that multimodal interventions that include exercise therapy may be effective for patellofemoral pain (PFP); however, no study has investigated the effects of trigger point (TrP) dry needling (DN) in people with PFP. Objectives To compare the effects of adding TrP DN to a manual therapy and exercise program on pain, function, and disability in individuals with PFP. Methods Individuals with PFP (n = 60) recruited from a public hospital in Valencia, Spain were randomly allocated to manual therapy and exercises (n = 30) or manual therapy and exercise plus TrP DN (n = 30). Both groups received the same manual therapy and strengthening exercise program for 3 sessions (once a week for 3 weeks), and 1 group also received TrP DN to active TrPs within the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles. The pain subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; 0-100 scale) was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included other subscales of the KOOS, the Knee Society Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC), and the numeric pain-rating scale. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 15-day (posttreatment) and 3-month follow-ups. Analysis was conducted with mixed analyses of covariance, adjusted for baseline scores. Results At 3 months, 58 subjects (97%) completed the follow-up. No significant between-group differences (all, P>.391) were observed for any outcome: KOOS pain subscale mean difference, -2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.6, 0.4); IKDC mean difference, 2.3 (95% CI: -0.1, 4.7); knee pain intensity mean difference, 0.3 (95% CI: -0.2, 0.8). Both groups experienced similar moderate-to-large within-group improvements in all outcomes (standardized mean differences of 0.6 to 1.1); however, only the KOOS function in sport and recreation subscale surpassed the prespecified minimum important change. Conclusion The current clinical trial suggests that the inclusion of 3 sessions of TrP DN in a manual therapy and exercise program did not result in improved outcomes for pain and disability in individuals with PFP at 3-month follow-up.

Pentoxifylline, a TNF inhibitor, has been successfully used in association with Sb(v) in mucosal and cutaneous leishmaniasis. This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral pentoxifylline plus Sb(v) versus placebo plus Sb(v) in patients with CL in Bahia, Brazil. A total of 164 patients were randomized in two groups to receive the combination or the monotherapy. Cure rate 6 months after treatment was 45% in the pentoxifylline group and 43% in the control group. There was also no difference between the groups regarding the healing time (99.7 \xc2\xb1 66.2 days and 98.1 \xc2\xb1 72.7 days, respectively).

There is now an abundance of research demonstrating that mindfulness training has beneficial effects across a wide range of clinical conditions, making it an important tool for clinical intervention. One area of extensive research is on the beneficial effects of mindfulness on experiences of pain. However, the mechanisms of these effects are still not well understood. One hypothesis is that the relaxation components of mindfulness training, through alterations in breathing and muscle tension, leads to changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system functioning which influences pain circuits. The current study seeks to examine how two of the relaxation subcomponents of mindfulness training, deep breathing and muscle relaxation, influence experiences of pain in healthy individuals. Participants were randomized to either a 10 minute deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or control condition after which they were exposed to a cold pain task. Throughout the experiment, measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity were collected to assess how deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation alter physiological responses, and if these changes moderate any effects of these interventions on responses to pain. There were no differences in participants' pain tolerances or self-reported pain ratings during the cold pain task or in participants' physiological responses to the task. Additionally, individual differences in physiological functioning were not related to differences in pain tolerance or pain ratings. Overall this study suggests that the mechanisms through which mindfulness exerts its effects on pain are more complex than merely through physiological changes brought about by altering breathing or muscle tension.

Menthol cigarette use, versus nonmenthol cigarette use, slows nicotine metabolism and therefore may attenuate the effect of NMR on smoking abstinence. In this study, we evaluated whether cigarette type (menthol vs. nonmenthol) modified the association between NMR and short-term abstinence. This was a secondary analysis examining treatment in the first 8 weeks of 21 mg/day nicotine patch therapy in a completed clinical trial (n = 474). Menthol cigarette use was based on self-report. NMR was defined dichotomously (0 = fast, 1 = slow) to distinguish between fast (\xe2\x89\xa50.47) versus slow NMR. Using logistic regression analysis, we tested whether cigarette type moderated the association between NMR and bioverified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at Week 8. Covariates include nicotine dependence, age, race, and gender. Three hundred two participants reported smoking menthol cigarettes, of which 234 (77%) were classified as slow NMR. Among the 172 nonmenthol smokers, 136 were classified as slow NMR (79%). Contrary to our expectations, the NMR \xc3\x97Cigarette Type interaction effect on abstinence was not significant (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91, p = .86). Excluding the interaction variable, fast NMR was associated with decreased likelihood of abstinence (OR = 0.55, p = .03), but menthol cigarette use was not (OR = 1.15, p = .56). Further exploration of risk factors among menthol cigarette smokers, especially among racially diverse and light smokers, could clarify the association between menthol cigarette use and poorer smoking outcomes.

Building on prior research on the effects of alcohol, initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions on gambling behaviors using a chance-based (nonstrategic) slot-machine task, the current study explored the impact of these factors on a skill-based (strategic) video poker task. We anticipated larger average bets and greater gambling persistence under alcohol relative to placebo, and expected alcohol effects to be moderated by initial gambling outcomes, impulsivity, and gambling cognitions. Participants (N = 162; 25.9% female) were randomly assigned to alcohol (target BrAC = .08g%) or placebo and were given $10 to wager on a simulated video poker task, which was programmed to produce 1 of 3 initial outcomes (win, breakeven, or lose) before beginning a progressive loss schedule. Despite evidence for validity of the video poker task and alcohol administration paradigm, primary hypotheses were not supported. Individuals who received alcohol placed smaller wagers than participants in the placebo condition, though this effect was not statistically significant, and the direction of effects was reversed in at-risk gamblers (n = 41). These findings contradict prior research and suggest that alcohol effects on gambling behavior may differ by gambling type (nonstrategic vs. strategic games). Interventions that suggest alcohol is universally disinhibiting may be at odds with young adults' lived experience and thus be less effective than those that recognize the greater complexity of alcohol effects.

However, alcohol-induced disinhibition does not occur in all contexts in the real world. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine if actions taken (or not) under alcohol will impact observed inhibitory control and how behavioral control requirements under alcohol alter perceived levels of impairment. Participants (n = 40) of equal sex who were social drinkers participated in a 3 session laboratory study that involved the administration of placebo, 0.45g/kg, and 0.65g/kg doses of alcohol. Participants were randomly assigned to a modified cued go/no-go reaction time (RT) task that included more go trials (activational condition) or more no-go trials (inhibitory condition). On all sessions after dose administration, participants completed their assigned cued go/no-go computer task and gave subjective ratings of impairment. The results indicated that participants in the activational condition under all doses of alcohol, but particularly the highest dose of alcohol, displayed poorer behavioral control (i.e., greater inhibitory failures) but self-reported lower perceived impairment, when compared to participants in the inhibitory condition. Therefore, this study provides laboratory evidence that alcohol consumption in an active setting will lead to greater disinhibition and reduced perceptions of impairment of behavior. The findings highlight the importance of the drinking setting when examining the acute effects of alcohol and suggest potential avenues for harm reduction for individuals who have difficulty controlling their alcohol intake.

Sixteen normal-weight, healthy Chinese men completed the study [mean \xc2\xb1 SD age: 28 \xc2\xb1 6 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 22.9 \xc2\xb1 3.1]. After an overnight fast, participants had their body weight measured and entered an indirect whole-room calorimeter (WRC). After baseline measurements, participants consumed orange juice and rice porridge alone (control), with 22.25 g coconut oil or sunflower oil or with 25 g coconut oleogel or sunflower oleogel in random order with a 5-d washout period between treatments. EE, substrate oxidation, capillary blood glucose, and appetite were measured over 195 min in a WRC. Participants completed a meal challenge to assess appetite. Test meals effects were compared by using repeated-measures ANOVA.Results: Fat saturation did not affect all study outcomes significantly. When data were pooled based on the physical form of dietary fat, EE did not differ. However, significantly higher carbohydrate oxidation (P = 0.03) and a trend of lower fat oxidation (P = 0.07) were found after the liquid oil than after the oleogel or control treatments. Postprandial capillary glucose was also significantly lower after the liquid oil than after the oleogel or control treatments (P < 0.001). Appetite was not affected by the physical form and the saturation of dietary fats.Conclusions: The saturation of dietary fat did not affect postprandial glucose, EE, substrate oxidation, or appetite. However, oleogel prevented the glycemic-lowering and fat-oxidation effects induced by liquid oil in Chinese men. Future work on oleogel should focus on cardiometabolic risk factors.

The highest dose reduced brachial systolic BP (5.6 mmHg, P = 0.003), central systolic BP (5.6 mmHg, P = 0.035), and CH2O (maximum change from 3.79 to 1.27 ml/min, P = 0.031) and increased P-[Formula: see text] (from 0.065 to 0.766 \xce\xbcmol/l, P < 0.001), while reducing U-cGMP (from 444 to 247 pmol/min, P = 0.004).

In conclusion, intravenous NaNO2 induced a dose-dependent reduction of brachial and central BP. The hemodynamic effect was not mediated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. NaNO2 infusion resulted in a vasopressin-independent decrease in CH2O and urine output but no change in urinary sodium excretion or GFR.

Existing clinical trials have been limited by short duration, low doses of vitamin D, variability in participants' vitamin D-deficiency status, and the use of surrogate measures of body composition, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion.Objective: To address existing knowledge gaps, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation that is provided in a sufficient dose and duration to vitamin D-deficient individuals would improve insulin sensitivity or secretion as measured with the use of gold-standard methods. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would improve insulin sensitivity and secretion compared with placebo.Design: Sixty-five overweight or obese, vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration \xe2\x89\xa450 nmol/L) adults were randomly assigned to receive either a bolus oral dose of 100,000 IU cholecalciferol followed by 4000 IU cholecalciferol/d or a matching placebo for 16 wk. Before and after the intervention, participants received gold-standard assessments of body composition (via dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (via hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), and insulin secretion [via intravenous-glucose-tolerance tests (IVGTTs)].Results: Fifty-four participants completed the study [35 men and 19 women; mean \xc2\xb1 SD age: 31.9 \xc2\xb1 8.5 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30.9 \xc2\xb1 4.4]. 25(OH)D increased with vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo (57.0 \xc2\xb1 21.3 compared with 1.9 \xc2\xb1 15.1 nmol/L, respectively; P = 0.02).

Individual trajectories from 6 mo before conception to 30 wk of gestation were produced with the use of multilevel modeling. Summary traits were expressed as weight z scores [weight z score at 3 mo preconception (zwt-3 mo), weight z score at conception, weight z score at 3 mo postconception, weight z score at 7 mo postconception (zwt+7 mo), and conditional measures that represented the change from the preceding time] and were related to SGA risk with the use of Poisson regression with confounder adjustment; linear splines were used to account for nonlinearity.Results: Maternal weight at each time point had a consistent nonlinear relation with SGA risk. For example, the zwt-3 mo estimate was stronger in women with values \xe2\x89\xa40.5 (RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.594, 0.910) than in women with values >0.5 (RR: 0.920; 95% CI: 0.682, 1.241). The former group had the highest observed SGA prevalence. Focusing on weight change, only conditional zwt+7 mo was associated with SGA and only in women with values >-0.5 (RR: 0.579; 95% CI: 0.463, 0.724).Conclusions: Protection against delivering an SGA neonate offered by greater preconceptional or gestational weight may be most pronounced in more undernourished and vulnerable women. Independent of this possibility, greater second- and third-trimester weight gain beyond a threshold may be protective. This trial was registered at http://www.isrctn.com/ as ISRCTN49285450.'"

Here, we investigated the prevalence of LBP and the effect of a 24-month non-specific PA intervention on changes in LBP prevalence in a series of Italian healthy postmenopausal women. We performed a secondary analysis in the frame of the DAMA trial, a factorial randomized intervention trial aimed to evaluate the ability of a 24-month intervention, based on moderate-intensity PA, and/or dietary modification, in reducing mammographic breast density in healthy postmenopausal women. The PA intervention included at least 1 hour/day of moderate PA and a more strenuous weekly activity, collective walks and theoretical group sessions. A self-administered pain questionnaire was administered at baseline and at the end of the intervention. The questionnaire was specifically structured to investigate the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain, the body localization, intensity and duration of the pain. Two hundred and ten women (102 randomized to PA intervention, 108 not receiving the PA intervention) filled out the questionnaires. At baseline LBP was present in 32.9% of the participants. Among women randomized to the PA intervention, LBP prevalence at follow up (21.6%) was lower than at baseline (33.3%) (p = 0.02), while in women who did not receive the PA intervention the LBP prevalence at baseline and follow up were 32.4% and 25.9%, respectively (p = 0.30).

In Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 30203, we found that the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in addition to chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). CALGB 30801 (Alliance) was designed to prospectively confirm that finding. Patients and Methods Patients with NSCLC (stage IIIB with pleural effusion or stage IV according to American Joint Committee on Cancer [sixth edition] criteria) were preregistered, and biopsy specimens were analyzed for COX-2 by IHC. Patients with COX-2 expression \xe2\x89\xa5 2, performance status of 0 to 2, and normal organ function were eligible. Chemotherapy was determined by histology: carboplatin plus pemetrexed for nonsquamous NSCLC and carboplatin plus gemcitabine for squamous histology. Patients were randomly assigned to celecoxib (400 mg twice per day; arm A) or placebo (arm B). The primary objective was to demonstrate improvement in progression-free survival in patients with COX-2 index \xe2\x89\xa5 4 with hazard ratio of 0.645 with approximately 85% power at two-sided significance level of .05. Results The study was halted for futility after 312 of the planned 322 patients with COX-2 index \xe2\x89\xa5 2 were randomly assigned. There were no significant differences between the groups (hazard ratio, 1.046 for COX-2 \xe2\x89\xa5 4). Subset analyses evaluating histology, chemotherapy regimen, and incremental COX-2 expression did not demonstrate any advantage for COX-2 inhibition. Elevation of baseline urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2, indicating activation of the COX-2 pathway, was a negative prognostic factor. Values above the third quartile may have been a predictive factor. Conclusion COX-2 expression by IHC failed to select patients who could benefit from selective COX-2 inhibition. Urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2 may be able to identify patients who could benefit from COX-2 inhibition.'"

Patients and Methods This was a randomized, partially blinded, noninferiority trial that involved survivors of breast cancer with insomnia who were recruited from the Los Angeles community from April 2008 to July 2012. After a 2-month phase-in period with repeated baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to 3 months of CBT-I or TCC and evaluated at months 2, 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 15 (follow-up). Primary outcome was insomnia treatment response-that is, marked clinical improvement of symptoms by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-at 15 months. Secondary outcomes were clinician-assessed remission of insomnia; sleep quality; total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and awake after sleep onset, derived from sleep diaries; polysomnography; and symptoms of fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Results Of 145 participants who were screened, 90 were randomly assigned (CBT-I: n = 45; TCC: n = 45). The proportion of participants who showed insomnia treatment response at 15 months was 43.7% and 46.7% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. Tests of noninferiority showed that TCC was noninferior to CBT-I at 15 months ( P = .02) and at months 3 ( P = .02) and 6 ( P < .01). For secondary outcomes, insomnia remission was 46.2% and 37.9% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. CBT-I and TCC groups showed robust improvements in sleep quality, sleep diary measures, and related symptoms (all P < .01), but not polysomnography, with similar improvements in both groups.

However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n\xc2\xb0 lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized \xce\xb2 =0.268), mental flexibility (\xce\xb2 =0.306), verbal fluency (\xce\xb2 =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (\xce\xb2 =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review.

Earlier, we reported the direct 3-month results of an online modified mindfulness-based stress reduction training in patients with heart disease, and now we evaluate the effect at 12-month follow-up. 324 patients (mean age 43.2 years, 53.7% male) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to additional 3-month online mindfulness training or to usual care alone. The primary outcome was exercise capacity measured with the 6 minute walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, NT-proBNP, cortisol levels (scalp hair sample), mental and physical functioning (SF-36), anxiety and depression (HADS), perceived stress (PSS), and social support (PSSS12). Differences between groups on the repeated outcome measures were analyzed with linear mixed models. At 12-months follow-up, participants showed a trend significant improvement exercise capacity (6MWT: 17.9 meters, p = 0.055) compared to UC. Cohen's D showed significant but small improvement on exercise capacity (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.39), systolic blood pressure (d = 0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36), mental functioning (d = 0.22; 95%CI 0.05 to 0.38) and depressive symptomatology (d = 0.18; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.35). All other outcome measures did not change statistically significantly. In the as-treated analysis, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly with 5.5 mmHg (p = 0.045; d = 0.23 (95%CI 0.05-0.41)). Online mindfulness training shows favorable albeit small long-term effects on exercise capacity, systolic blood pressure, mental functioning, and depressive symptomatology in patients with heart disease and might therefore be a beneficial addition to current clinical care."""

Whether azacitidine-based combinations with lenalidomide or vorinostat produce superior overall response rates (ORRs) to azacitidine is not known. Patients and Methods North American Intergroup Study S1117 is a phase II/III trial that randomly assigned patients with higher-risk MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 1:1:1 to azacitidine (75 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle); azacitidine plus lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1 to 21); or azacitidine plus vorinostat (300 mg twice daily on days 3 to 9). The primary phase II end point was improved ORR. Results Of 277 patients from 90 centers, 92 received azacitidine, 93 received azacitidine plus lenalidomide, and 92 received azacitidine plus vorinostat. Median age was 70 years (range, 28 to 93 years), 85 patients (31%) were female, and 53 patients (19%) had CMML. Serious adverse events were similar across arms, although combination-arm patients were more likely to undergo nonprotocol-defined dose modifications ( P < .001).With a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 1 to 43 months), the ORR was 38% for patients receiving azacitidine, 49% for azacitidine plus lenalidomide ( P = .14 v azacitidine), and 27% for azacitidine plus vorinostat ( P = .16 v azacitidine). For patients with CMML, ORR was higher for azacitidine plus lenalidomide versus azacitidine (68% v 28%, P = .02) but similar for all arms across cytogenetic subgroups, as was remission duration and overall survival. ORR was higher with mutations in DNMT3A and lower for SRSF2, whereas ORR duration improved with fewer mutations. Lenalidomide dose reduction was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.30; P = .05). Conclusion Patients with higher-risk MDS treated with azacitidine-based combinations had similar ORR to azacitidine monotherapy, although patients with CMML benefitted from azacitidine plus lenalidomide.

Method: From November 2012 to September 2013, ten research units of large teaching hospitals or children's hospitals participated in this multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial. Hospitalized young children aged between 1 month and 3 years (nongastrointestinal infection and antibiotic therapy required)were involved in our study. The children were randomly divided into control group and prevention group by means of block random allocation method. The control group received antibiotic therapy and other conventional treatment. The prevention group was given additional Saccharomyces boulardii (250 mg/d) orally. Diarrhea rates of two groups were compared both during the usage of antibiotics and within 14 days after the antibiotics withdrawal. The adverse reactions of Saccharomyces boulardii were observed all through this study. The results were analyzed by \xcf\x87(2) test or Kruskal-Wallis test or t test. Result: Totally 408 cases (213 cases in prevention group and 195 cases in control group) were enrolled. The age ranged from 1 month to 3 years, with an average age of 1.14 years. The basic diseases were parenteral infections: 368 cases with different kinds of respiratory tract infections or pneumonia, 10 cases of bacterial meningitis, 9 cases with septicemia or sepsis, 6 cases with pertussis or pertussis like syndrome, 5 cases with urinary infection, 5 cases with skin or subcutaneous tissue infections, 3 cases of Kawasaki disease, one with scarlet fever and one with congenital syphilis. During the administration of antibiotics, the incidence of AAD in prevention group was 10.3% (22 cases), which was significantly lower than that of control group (57 cases, 29.2%, \xcf\x87(2)=23.296, P<0.05). Within 14 days after the discontinuation of antibiotics, the percent of new diarrhea cases in prevention group (2.4%, 5/213) was also significantly lower than that in control group (16.4%, 32/195, \xcf\x87(2)=23.4, P<0.05). Further analysis revealed that the rate of AAD in children less than or equal to 1 year old (25.1%, 52/207) was significantly higher than that of over 1 year old (13.4%, 27/201, \xcf\x87(2)=8.922, P<0.05). The incidence of AAD in children treated with antibiotics for more than 5 days was 22.2%(60/270), which was significantly higher than that of less than or equal to 5 days (13.8%, 19/138, \xcf\x87(2)=4.180, P<0.05). Although no significant difference was observed, the AAD rate of patients with combined use of two antibiotics was higher than that of using one. During the antibiotic therapy, compared with the control group, the risk of AAD in children under 1 year old was reduced by 52% (\xcf\x87(2)=9.217, P<0.05), and 91% (\xcf\x87(2)=20.35, P<0.05) in the children over 1 year old in prevention group. The risk of AAD of prevention group decreased by 66% (\xcf\x87(2)=13.67, P<0.05) in patients treated with one antibiotics, and 65% in children with combined use of antibiotics (\xcf\x87(2)=10.57, P<0.05). In patients treated with antibiotics for less than or equal to 5 days, the risk of AAD decreased by 74% in prevention group (\xcf\x87(2)=7.38, P<0.05); and 63% if the course lasted for over 5 days (\xcf\x87(2)=16.87, P<0.05). Within 14 days after the withdrawal of antibiotics, compared with the control group, the risk of diarrhea in the prevention group decreased by 82% (\xcf\x87(2)=13.35, P<0.05) in infants (\xe2\x89\xa41 year old) and 93% (\xcf\x87(2)=12.00, P<0.05) in children (>1 year old); the risk of diarrhea was reduced by 86% (\xcf\x87(2)=9.57, P<0.05) and 87% (\xcf\x87(2)=17.71, P<0.05) respectively in prevention group with single and combined use of antibiotics. In patients treated with antibiotics for more than 5 days, the risk of diarrhea in prevention group was reduced by 63% (\xcf\x87(2)=22.79, P<0.05), while there was no significant difference if the antibiotics course was less than or equal to 5 days (\xcf\x87(2)=2.97, P>0.05). No adverse effects related with Saccharomyces boulardii were observed in our study. Conclusion:Saccharomyces boulardii is effective and safe to prevent AAD of infants and young children both during the usage of antibiotics and up to 14 days after drug discontinuance. It can be one of the drugs of for choice prevention of AAD in infants and young children. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Tegister, ChiECRCT-2012-25."""

We examined the association of HIV diversity with virologic outcomes in adults from the HPTN 052 trial who initiated ART at CD4 cell counts of 350-550 cells/mm3. A high resolution melting (HRM) assay was used to analyze baseline (pre-treatment) HIV diversity in six regions in the HIV genome (two in gag, one in pol, and three in env) from 95 participants who failed ART. We analyzed the association of HIV diversity in each genomic region with baseline (pre-treatment) factors and three clinical outcomes: time to virologic suppression after ART initiation, time to ART failure, and emergence of HIV drug resistance at ART failure. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we did not find any association of baseline HIV diversity with demographic, laboratory, or clinical characteristics. For the 18 analyses performed for clinical outcomes evaluated, there was only one significant association: higher baseline HIV diversity in one of the three HIV env regions was associated with longer time to ART failure (p = 0.008).

Until now, research on statistical learning for actions has solely focused on individual action sequences, but many actions in daily life involve multiple actors in various interaction contexts. The current study is the first to investigate the role of statistical learning in tracking regularities between actions performed by different actors, and whether the social context characterizing their interaction influences learning. That is, are observers more likely to track regularities across actors if they are perceived as acting jointly as opposed to in parallel? We tested adults and toddlers to explore whether social context guides statistical learning and-if so-whether it does so from early in development. In a between-subjects eye-tracking experiment, participants were primed with a social context cue between two actors who either shared a goal of playing together ('Joint' condition) or stated the intention to act alone ('Parallel' condition). In subsequent videos, the actors performed sequential actions in which, for certain action pairs, the first actor's action reliably predicted the second actor's action. We analyzed predictive eye movements to upcoming actions as a measure of learning, and found that both adults and toddlers learned the statistical regularities across actors when their actions caused an effect. Further, adults with high statistical learning performance were sensitive to social context: those who observed actors with a shared goal were more likely to correctly predict upcoming actions. In contrast, there was no effect of social context in the toddler group, regardless of learning performance. These findings shed light on how adults and toddlers perceive statistical regularities across actors depending on the nature of the observed social situation and the resulting effects."""

SPB incidence in women who started consuming FA, IFA, and MMN before the 12th week of gestation (4.6%, 4.2%, and 3.9%, respectively) was significantly reduced compared with starting supplement use on or after the 12th gestational week (6.9%, 7.2%, and 6.4%, respectively). Starting use of FA, IFA, or MMN supplements before the 12th week of gestation produced a 41%-45% reduction in risk of SPB.

However, the balance of ER\xce\xb1/ER\xce\xb2 protein in the SAT nuclear fraction increased 10% in EPM compared to a 25% decrease in LPM women (group x treatment interaction, p<0.05). A greater proportion of ER\xce\xb1/ER\xce\xb2 protein in the nuclear fraction of SAT at baseline (placebo day) was associated with greater reduction in SAT insulin resistance (i.e., better suppression of lipolysis, EC50) in response to E2 (r = -0.431, p<0.05). In conclusion, there do not appear to be differences in the proportion of adipose tissue ER\xce\xb1/ER\xce\xb2 protein in late, compared to early, postmenopausal women.

Approximately one third of survivors report high FCR. This study aimed to evaluate whether blended cognitive behavior therapy (bCBT) can reduce the severity of FCR in cancer survivors curatively treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods This randomized controlled trial included 88 cancer survivors with high FCR (Cancer Worry Scale score \xe2\x89\xa5 14) from 6 months to 5 years after cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1, stratified by cancer type) to receive bCBT, including five face-to face and three online sessions (n = 45) or care as usual (CAU; n = 43). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0) and 3 months later (T1). The intervention group completed bCBT between T0 and T1. The primary outcome was FCR severity assessed with the Cancer Worry Scale. Secondary outcomes included other distress-related measures. Statistical (one-way between-group analyses of covariance) and clinical effects (clinically significant improvement) were analyzed by intention to treat. Results Participants who received bCBT reported significantly less FCR than those who received CAU (mean difference, -3.48; 95% CI, -4.69 to -2.28; P < .001) with a moderate-to-large effect size ( d = 0.76). Clinically significant improvement in FCR was significantly higher in the bCBT group than in the CAU group (13 [29%] of 45 compared with 0 [0%] of 43; P < .001); self-rated improvement was also higher in the bCBT group (30 [71%] of 42 compared with 12 [32%] of 38 in the CAU group; P < .001). Conclusion bCBT has a statistically and clinically significant effect on the severity of FCR in cancer survivors and is a promising new treatment approach.'"

DESIGN Randomized, blinded controlled trial. ANIMALS 40 healthy shelter-owned female dogs admitted to a student surgery program for ovariohysterectomy. PROCEDURES Dogs were randomly assigned to receive after ovariohysterectomy a 5-cm-wide strip of TLP applied topically on both sides of the incision, for the full length of the incision and a wound dressing (n = 19) or a placebo patch (nonmedicated wound dressing; 21). All dogs underwent midline ovariohysterectomy. Immediately afterward, dogs received 2 IM morphine injections, carprofen (SC, q 12 h for 2 days), and the assigned patch (left in place for 18 hours). Postoperative comfort was evaluated by use of the short form of the Glasgow Composite Measures Pain Scale and serum cortisol concentrations measured prior to premedication and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 18 hours after surgery. RESULTS No significant difference in pain scores or serum cortisol concentrations was identified between dogs that received the TLP and dogs that received a placebo patch after ovariohysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The TLP provided no additional analgesic benefit to dogs treated concurrently with recommended doses of morphine and carprofen following ovariohysterectomy. Additional studies are needed to investigate whether similar results might be achieved in dogs treated concurrently with other analgesics. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2017;250:1140-1147).'"

Here, we report the final efficacy analyses of this cohort. Patients and Methods Patients who remained disease free after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete a total of 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Given the large number of non-breast cancer-related deaths now reported, breast cancer-free survival (BCFS), with censorship of intercurrent deaths, was the primary survival end point of interest. Analyses focus on patients with estrogen receptor-positive or unknown tumors (n = 4,599). Results At the time of the data snapshot, median follow-up was 120 months. In the population that was estrogen receptor positive or had unknown estrogen receptor status, 1,111 BCFS events were observed with 508 (22.1%) of 2,294 patients in the exemestane group and 603 (26.2%) of 2,305 patients in the tamoxifen group. The data corresponded to an absolute difference (between exemestane and tamoxifen) at 10 years of 4.0% (95% CI, 1.2% to 6.7%), and the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.92) favored exemestane. This difference remained in multivariable analysis that was adjusted for nodal status, prior use of hormone replacement therapy, and prior chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.90; P < .001). A modest improvement in overall survival was seen with exemestane; the absolute difference (between exemestane and tamoxifen) at 10 years in the population that was estrogen receptor positive or had unknown estrogen receptor status was 2.1% (95% CI, -0.5% to 4.6%), and the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.01; P = .08). For the intention-to-treat population, the absolute difference was 1.6% (95% CI, -0.9% to 4.1%); the HR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.03, P = .15). No statistically significant difference was observed in the proportion of patients who reported a fracture event in the post-treatment period. Conclusion The Intergroup Exemestane Study and contemporaneous studies have established that a strategy of switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen can lead to sustained benefits in terms of reduction of disease recurrence and breast cancer mortality.'"

Calcium intakes, primarily from food, have been directly associated with circulating IGF-1, but whether supplemental calcium affects IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 is unknown. We tested the effects of 1.0 and 2.0\xe2\x80\x89g of supplemental elemental calcium daily on circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations in colorectal adenoma patients in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89193). IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunoassay and quantitative Western ligand blot, respectively. We also assessed cross-sectional associations of these biomarkers with participants' baseline characteristics. We found no appreciable effect of calcium relative to placebo on circulating IGF-1, IGFBP-3, or the IGF-1:IGFBP-3 molar ratio. Mean IGF-1 concentrations were 11.1% higher in those with greater milk intakes (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.05). Mean IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations were, respectively, 18.0% (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003) and 16.5% (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01) higher in men and were monotonically lower with increasing age (both P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01). IGFBP-3 was 17.7% higher among those with higher relative to no alcohol consumption (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.04). While these results support previous findings that IGF-1 concentrations are higher with greater milk intakes, and IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations differ according to sex and age, they provide no evidence to suggest that supplemental calcium appreciably affects circulating IGF-1, IGFBP-3, or the IGF-1:IGFBP-3 molar ratio in sporadic colorectal adenoma patients."""

Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the impact of acute sugar and caffeine intake on the metabolic health status by using a metabolomic multi-platform based on the combination of flow injection mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. To this end, we performed a randomized, crossover and double-blind intervention study with different soft drinks from the same brand. Numerous metabolomic changes were detected in serum samples over time after the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, including energy-related metabolites, amino acids and lipids, thus demonstrating the intense effects provoked by acute sugar consumption on the organism during 3 h of follow-up.

We recorded outcome measures preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form (HOOS-PS) as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were HOOS-Pain, HOOS-Quality-Of-Life, EQ-5D, UCLA Activity Score, and limping. Results - We found no statistically significant difference in the improvements in HOOS-PS between the treatment groups at 12-month follow-up. All secondary outcomes showed similar results except for limping, where PA patients improved significantly more than LA patients. Interpretation - Contrary to our hypothesis, patients treated with PA did not improve more than patients treated with LA regarding physical function, pain, physical activity, and quality of life 12 months postoperatively. However, limping was more pronounced in the LA patients.'"

Six diets, containing different levels of RPB (0 or 160 g/kg of DM) and DOP (0, 110, or 220 g/kg of DM), were randomly assigned to 6 groups of 6 lambs each for a 74-d period (14 d for adaptation and 60 d for data collection). Diets were offered as total mixed ration to ensure 10% of orts. Feed intake, growth, diet digestibility, microbial nitrogen (N) synthesis (MNS), N retention, rumen fermentation parameters, and blood metabolites were determined. Data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED of SAS. Increasing RPB and DOP levels in the diet of the lambs improved ( < 0.05) DMI, ADG, and G:F. Diet digestibility was not affected by dietary feeding of RPB ( > 0.05), but increased as DOP level increased in the diet ( < 0.05). Feeding RPB and DOP had no effects ( > 0.05) on the ruminal pH. The ruminal total VFA concentration, molar proportion of acetic acid, and acetate-to-propionate ratio increased ( < 0.05) with the increasing dietary levels of RPB and DOP, while ammonia N concentration, propionic acid proportion, total protozoa count, and subfamily number decreased ( < 0.05). Including RPB and DOP in diet enhanced ( < 0.05) MNS and N retention. Feeding RPB-containing diets caused ( < 0.05) an increase of plasma glucose concentration and decreases ( < 0.05) of cholesterol and urea N. As the dietary level of DOP increased, the plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, and urea N reduced ( < 0.05). The plasma antioxidant power was not affected ( > 0.05) by feeding RPB, but increased ( < 0.05) with increasing DOP level in diet. The animal performance reached its greatest value with simultaneous feeding of 160 g of RPB and 220 g of DOP per kg of diet DM. It has been concluded that the partial dietary substitution of RPB (instead of soybean meal, wheat bran, and sugar beet pulp) or/and DOP (instead of barley grain and corn grain) in fattening Shal lambs had positive effects on feed intake, diet digestibility, ruminal microbial N, growth, and N retention. Synchronized feeding of the great levels of RPB (as an N source) and DOP (as an energy source) increased utilization efficiency of these byproducts in the fattening lambs.'"

Supplements differed only by source of Cu, Zn, and Mn, which included hydroxychloride (hydroxy), sulfate, and organic options. In each trial, the 3 supplements were simultaneously offered to 8 pens of early-weaned calves (2 calves/pen; 126 \xc2\xb1 8.0 kg average BW) for a 4-h period and preferential intake was determined. When offered the opportunity to select among 3 supplement options, calves consumed more ( < 0.001) supplement containing hydroxy vs. organic or sulfate sources of Cu (Trial 1), Zn (Trial 2), and Mn (Trial 3). In Trial 4, when all 3 elements were combined within a single supplement, calves almost exclusively selected ( < 0.001) the hydroxy vs. organic or sulfate sources (82.9, 10.4, and 6.7% of total supplement intake, respectively [SEM 3.16]). In Exp. 2, calves were supplemented at a rate of 114 g/calf daily for 84 d before weaning (2 calves/pasture; 10 and 12 pastures in yr 1 and 2, respectively). Supplements were formulated to contain no supplemental minerals (control); hydroxy Cu, Zn, and Mn; or copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, and manganese oxide (sulfate/oxide). Total supplement intake was greater ( = 0.01) for calves consuming the hydroxy vs. the sulfate/oxide sources of Cu, Zn, and Mn (9.0 vs. 7.2 kg [SEM 0.45]).

Calves provided mineral-fortified vs. control supplements had greater ( \xe2\x89\xa4 0.05) peak concentrations of ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin and less BW gain during in the 16-d postweaning period. These data demonstrate greater voluntary intake of mineral-concentrated supplements among calves offered hydroxy vs. sulfate or organic sources of Cu, Zn, and Mn. Preweaning mineral-fortified supplementation increased calf mineral status, heightened inflammatory responsiveness, and decreased BW gain during the immediate postweaning period.'"

Experimental diets were formulated with 2 concentrations of Ca and P (macromineral factor; diet supplying 100% of Ca and P according to BR-CORTE () [CaP+] or diet without limestone and dicalcium phosphate [CaP-]) and 2 concentrations of microminerals (micromineral factor; diet with supplementation of microminerals [Zn, Mn, and Cu; CuMnZn+] or diet without supplementation of microminerals [Zn, Mn, and Cu; CuMnZn-]). The factor CaP- was formulated without the addition of limestone and dicalcium phosphate, and the factor CuMnZn- was formulated without inorganic supplementation of microminerals (premix). The diets were isonitrogenous (13.3% CP). Intake was individually monitored every day. Indigestible NDF was used as an internal marker for digestibility estimates.

Ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery distal to the left colic artery or the complete preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery can therefore be compared in terms of preservation of the descending sympathetic fibres running along the aorta to the rectum resulting in a different post operative genito urinary function. From January 2015 to March 2016, 66 patients underwent elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease among two enrolling hospitals. In one centre 35 patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with the ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery distal to the left colic artery (low ligation). In the other centre 31 patient were operated on the same procedure with complete inferior mesenteric artery preservation (IMA preservation). There was no difference in terms of major complication occurred, first passage of stool and length of hospital stay between the two groups. Time of surgery was significantly shorter in LL group compared to IMA preserving group and intra operative blood loss was significantly lower in the LL group. There were no differences in the genito urinary function between the two group pre operatively, at 1 and 9 months post operatively. Genito urinary function did not significantly change across surgery in each groups. The low ligation and the IMA preserving vascular approach are safe end feasible techniques in elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease. They both prevent from genito-urinary post-operative disfunction and allow good post operative quality of life. The low ligation approach is related to shorter operative time and slower intra operative blood loss.'"

Patients and Methods Within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial that compared a busulfan-based RIC with MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 129 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified according to donor, age, and blast count. Results Engraftment was comparable between both groups. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease II to IV was 32.3% after RIC and 37.5% after MAC ( P = .35). The CI of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.6% after RIC and 64.7% after MAC ( P = .76). The CI of nonrelapse mortality after 1 year was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 25% (95% CI, 15% to 36%) after MAC ( P = .29). The CI of relapse at 2 years was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 15% (95% CI, 6% to 24%) after MAC ( P = .6), which resulted in a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 62% (95% CI, 50% to 74%) and 76% (95% CI, 66% to 87%), respectively, after RIC, and 58% (95% CI, 46% to 71%) and 63% (95% CI, 51% to 75%), respectively, after MAC ( P = .58 and P = .08, respectively). Conclusion This prospective, randomized trial of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation provides evidence that RIC resulted in at least a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival similar to MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.'"

Study Design Randomized single-blinded controlled crossover trial. Setting Temporal bone laboratory of an academic otolaryngology department. Subjects and Methods This study involved the simulated insertion of a stapes prosthesis into a model of the ossicular chain under microscopy. Forty-one participants were recruited from our medical and dental school and randomized into 2 groups. All groups began by performing the task without gloves, acting as their own control arm. The first group (A) then performed the task with a single pair of gloves while the second group (B) next performed the task with 2 pairs of gloves. The groups then switched gloving methods. The total time taken to perform the task was recorded for each participant and the results subjected to a series of statistical measures. Results This study found a statistically significant difference in the average time taken to complete the task between the ""no-glove"" arm of the study and both experimental groups but no difference between the 2 experimental groups. Likewise, no significant difference was found between the 2 experimental groups when comparing the rate at which they improved at performing the task.

Bimanual palpation and ultrasonography were performed in the patient and control groups. The electrolyte, protein, and fetuin-A levels of the serum and saliva were measured. Results The serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels of the patients were significantly lower than those of the control group (respectively, P = .04, P = .01, P = .04). There was no statistically significant difference between the serum fetuin-A levels of the 2 groups ( P = .06). The saliva phosphorus values of the patients were higher than those of the control group ( P = .05), as were their saliva fetuin-A and total protein values ( P = .001, P = .01). A positive correlation was determined between the saliva fetuin-A levels and the saliva phosphorus and potassium levels of the patients ( P = .04, P = .02). The magnesium level, which has been argued to be a factor in the prevention of calcification, showed an increased correlation with the total protein in the patient group ( P = .02). Conclusion It is possible that the high levels of saliva fetuin-A, total protein, and phosphorus with insufficient of saliva magnesium levels may make a contribution to the formation of sialoliths.'"

Complete or partial molecular response was observed in 3 patients (ruxolitinib-randomized, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa02; ruxolitinib crossover, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01) and 54 patients (ruxolitinib-randomized, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa033; ruxolitinib crossover, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa020; BAT, n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01), respectively. Among patients treated with interferon as BAT (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa013), the mean maximal reduction in allele burden from baseline was 25.6% after crossover to ruxolitinib versus 6.6% before crossover. Collectively, the data from this exploratory analysis suggest that ruxolitinib treatment for up to 4\xc2\xa0years provides progressive reductions in JAK2 p.V617F allele burden in patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. The relationship between allele burden changes and clinical outcomes in patients with PV remains unclear.'"

We hypothesized that reducing mouse allergen exposure may modulate the immunopathology underlying symptomatic pediatric allergic asthma, and that this occurs through epigenetic regulation. To test this hypothesis, we studied a cohort of mouse sensitized, persistent asthmatic inner-city children undergoing mouse allergen-targeted integrated pest management (IPM) vs education in a randomized controlled intervention trial. We found that decreasing mouse allergen exposure, but not cockroach, was associated with reduced FOXP3 buccal DNA promoter methylation, but this was unrelated to mouse specific IgE production. This finding suggests that the environmental epigenetic regulation of an immunomodulatory gene may occur following changing allergen exposures in some highly exposed cohorts. Given the clinical and public health importance of inner-city pediatric asthma and the potential impact of environmental interventions, further studies will be needed to corroborate changes in epigenetic regulation following changing exposures over time, and determine their impact on asthma morbidity in susceptible children.'"

Third-trimester fasting plasma amino acid kinetics were measured by infusing 1-(13)C,methyl-(2)H3-methionine, ring-(2)H5-phenylalanine, ring-(2)H4-tyrosine,1-(13)C-glycine, and 2,3,3-(2)H3,(15)N-serine in a subset of participants. Placental mRNA expression of genes involved in methionine pathways, placental long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (LINE-1) methylation, and promoter methylation levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analyzed.Results: Remethylation rates in the M+B-12, M+P, and P groups were 5.1 \xc2\xb1 1.7, 4.1 \xc2\xb1 1.0, and, 5.0 \xc2\xb1 1.4 \xce\xbcmol \xe2\x8b\x85 kg(-1) \xe2\x8b\x85 h(-1), respectively (P = 0.057), such that the percentage of transmethylation remethylated to methionine tended to be higher in the M+B-12 group (49.5% \xc2\xb1 10.5%) than in the M+P group (42.3% \xc2\xb1 8.4%; P = 0.053) but neither differed from the P group (44.2% \xc2\xb1 8.1%; P > 0.1). Placental mRNA expression, LINE-1, and VEGF promoter methylation did not differ between groups.Conclusions: Combined vitamin B-12 and balanced protein-energy supplementation increased the homocysteine remethylation rate in late pregnancy. Thus, vitamin B-12 along with balanced protein-energy supplementation is critical for optimal functioning of the methionine cycle in the third trimester of pregnancy in Indian women with low serum vitamin B-12 in early pregnancy.

The postpartum period is a physiologically unique life stage in which the relations between these proteins and other markers of inflammation have not been extensively studied.Objective: We aimed to determine whether 2 markers of inflammation [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and \xce\xb11-acid glycoprotein (AGP)] were associated with ferritin or hepcidin in postpartum women in California.Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled iron-intervention trial. Plasma CRP, AGP, ferritin, and hepcidin were analyzed at 2 and 17 wk postpartum in 114 lactating women. We examined Pearson correlation coefficients between all biomarkers at both time points and differences in mean values of ferritin and hepcidin between those with and without elevated CRP and/or AGP.Results: At 2 and 17 wk postpartum, 58% and 26% of women had CRP >5 mg/L and 78% and 29% had AGP >1 g/L, respectively. Neither CRP nor AGP was significantly correlated with ferritin (r = 0.07 and -0.06; n = 114 at 2 wk; -0.14 and -0.14; n = 95 at 17 wk) or hepcidin (r = 0.18 and -0.03 at 2 wk; -0.05 and -0.14 at 17 wk; P > 0.05 for all). At 2 wk, geometric mean plasma ferritin and hepcidin concentrations did not differ between women with and without elevated CRP or AGP (P > 0.5), but at 17 wk women with elevated CRP or AGP had lower mean (95% CI) ferritin and hepcidin than did women without either elevated CRP or AGP [ferritin: 30.3 ng/mL (23.4, 39.1 ng/mL) compared with 40.2 ng/mL (32.9, 49.2 ng/mL); P < 0.01; hepcidin: 44.3 ng/mL (32.3, 60.9 ng/mL) compared with 67.6 ng/mL (56.1, 81.5 ng/mL); P = 0.02].Conclusion: Lower ferritin and hepcidin among women with elevated CRP or AGP at 17 wk postpartum suggests that these markers of iron status react differently to physiologic immune activation than to pathologic inflammatory states.'"

Mobile phone technology has been successful in changing behaviors and managing weight; however, to our knowledge, its potential in young children has yet to be examined.Objective: We assessed the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) obesity prevention program on body fat, dietary habits, and physical activity in healthy Swedish children aged 4.5 y.Design: From 2014 to 2015, 315 children were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Parents in the intervention group received a 6-mo mHealth program. The primary outcome was fat mass index (FMI), whereas the secondary outcomes were intakes of fruits, vegetables, candy, and sweetened beverages and time spent sedentary and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Composite scores for the primary and secondary outcomes were computed.Results: No statistically significant intervention effect was observed for FMI between the intervention and control group (mean \xc2\xb1 SD: -0.23 \xc2\xb1 0.56 compared with -0.20 \xc2\xb1 0.49 kg/m(2)).

This improvement was more pronounced among the children with an FMI above the median (4.11 kg/m(2)) (P = 0.019). The odds of increasing the composite score for the 6 dietary and physical activity behaviors were 99% higher for the intervention group than the control group (P = 0.008).Conclusions: This mHealth obesity prevention study in preschool-aged children found no difference between the intervention and control group for FMI. However, the intervention group showed a considerably higher postintervention composite score (a secondary outcome) than the control group, especially in children with a higher FMI. Further studies targeting specific obesity classes within preschool-aged children are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02021786.'"

However, little is known about their roles in the regulation of net AA fluxes across skeletal muscle in vivo. This study was aimed to investigate the effect and related mechanisms of dietary supplementation of BCAA on muscle net amino acid (AA) fluxes using the hindlimb flux model. In all fourteen 4-week-old barrows were fed reduced-protein diets with or without supplemental BCAA for 28 d. Pigs were implanted with carotid arterial, femoral arterial and venous catheters, and fed once hourly with intraarterial infusion of p-amino hippurate. Arterial and venous plasma and muscle samples were obtained for the measurement of AA, branched-chain \xce\xb1-keto acids (BCKA) and 3-methylhistidine (3-MH). Metabolomes of venous plasma were determined by HPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS. BCAA-supplemented group showed elevated muscle net fluxes of total essential AA, non-essential AA and AA. As for individual AA, muscle net fluxes of each BCAA and their metabolites (alanine, glutamate and glutamine), along with those of histidine, methionine and several functional non-essential AA (glycine, proline and serine), were increased by BCAA supplementation. The elevated muscle net AA fluxes were associated with the increase in arterial and intramuscular concentrations of BCAA and venous metabolites including BCKA and free fatty acids, and were also related to the decrease in the intramuscular concentration of 3-MH. Correlation analysis indicated that muscle net AA fluxes are highly and positively correlated with arterial BCAA concentrations and muscle net BCKA production. In conclusion, supplementing BCAA to reduced-protein diet increases the arterial concentrations and intramuscular catabolism of BCAA, both of which would contribute to an increase of muscle net AA fluxes in young pigs.'"

Methods Patients \xe2\x89\xa5 18 years old with cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \xe2\x89\xa4 2, who had been receiving a stable regimen of opioid analgesics for \xe2\x89\xa5 2 weeks, had at least one constipation symptom despite laxative use, and no more than five spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) during the past 14 days, were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to oral, once-daily naldemedine 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg, or placebo, for 14 days. The primary end point was change in SBM frequency per week from baseline during the treatment period. Secondary end points included SBM responder rates, change from baseline in the frequency of SBM without straining, and complete SBM. Safety was also assessed. Results Of 227 patients who were randomly assigned, 225 were assessed for efficacy (naldemedine 0.1 mg, n = 55; 0.2 mg, n = 58; 0.4 mg, n = 56; placebo, n = 56) and 226 for safety. Change in SBM frequency (primary end point) was higher with all naldemedine doses versus placebo ( P < .05 for all comparisons), as were SBM responder rates and change in complete SBM frequency. Change in SBM frequency without straining was significantly improved with naldemedine 0.2 and 0.4 (but not 0.1) mg versus placebo (at least P < .05). Treatment-emergent adverse events were more common with naldemedine (0.1 mg: 66.1%; 0.2 mg: 67.2%; 0.4 mg: 78.6%) than placebo (51.8%); the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhea. Conclusion Fourteen-day treatment with naldemedine significantly improved opioid-induced constipation in patients with cancer and was generally well tolerated. Naldemedine 0.2 mg was selected for phase III studies.'"

We performed a case-control study nested within a previous randomized controlled trial of standard therapy plus adjuvant rituximab or placebo. We measured platelet-bound anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa and anti-GPIbIX using the antigen capture test. Of 55 evaluable patients, 25 (45%) had a detectable platelet autoantibody at baseline. Rituximab was associated with a significant reduction in anti-GPIIbIIIa levels (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00\xc2\xb702) but not anti-GPIbIX levels (P\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00\xc2\xb751) compared with placebo.

The purpose of the present study was to observe changes in neuroplasticity-related growth factors in the blood, assess cerebral blood flow velocity, and verify the resulting changes in children's cognitive function after TKD training. Thirty healthy elementary school students were randomly assigned to control (n = 15) and TKD (n = 15) groups. The TKD training was conducted for 60 min at a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 11-15, 5 times per week, for 16 weeks. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were measured by blood sampling before and after the training, and the cerebral blood flow velocities (peak systolic [MCAs], end diastolic [MCAd], mean cerebral blood flow velocities [MCAm], and pulsatility index [PI]) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were measured using Doppler ultrasonography. For cognitive function assessment, Stroop Color and Word Tests (Word, Color, and Color-Word) were administered along with other measurements. The serum BDNF, VEGF, and IGF-1 levels and the Color-Word test scores among the sub-factors of the Stroop Color and Word Test scores were significantly higher in the TKD group after the intervention (p < 0.05). On the other hand, no statistically significant differences were found in any factors related to cerebral blood flow velocities, or in the Word test and Color test scores (p > 0.05). Thus, 16-week TKD training did not significantly affect cerebral blood flow velocities, but the training may have been effective in increasing children's cognitive function by inducing an increase in the levels of neuroplasticity-related growth factors."""

ANIMALS 6 Beagles. PROCEDURES In a crossover study, dogs were fed thirty 1.5-mm barium-impregnated spheres (BIPS) and received a saline (0.9% NaCl) solution bolus (0.05 mL/kg) IV (time 0) followed by a CRI at 10 mL/h, a lidocaine bolus (1 mg/kg) IV followed by a CRI at 25 \xce\xbcg/kg/min, or a lidocaine bolus (1 mg/kg) IV followed by a CRI at 50 \xce\xbcg/kg/min; CRIs were for 12 hours. Nausea and sedation scores were assessed and abdominal radiographs obtained immediately after feeding of BIPS and every hour for 12 hours and again 16 hours after CRI start. Percentage of BIPSs in the small and large intestines, gastric emptying time, and gastrointestinal transit time were assessed. RESULTS Gastric emptying time did not differ significantly among treatments. Significantly more BIPS were in the large intestine 4 to 7 hours after treatment start for the 50-\xce\xbcg/kg/min treatment than for the other 2 treatments. Six hours after treatment start, significantly more BIPS were in the large intestine for the 25-\xce\xbcg/kg/min treatment than for the saline solution treatment. Higher sedation and nausea scores were associated with the 50-\xce\xbcg/kg/min CRI. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In clinically normal dogs, lidocaine CRI did not significantly affect gastric emptying.

The registry involved 23 centers, with patient enrollment from October 2012 to December 2015. We here report the 30-day outcomes of the whole population of the registry. We enrolled 1,505 consecutive patients, of which 82% were men and 22.4% diabetic. At presentation, 59.6% of the patients had an acute coronary syndrome, including 21% ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All lesions were pre-dilated and in 96.8% of the cases BVS was post-dilated. At 30\xc2\xa0days, the co-primary study end point target lesion revascularization occurred in 0.6% of patients and definite/probable BVS thrombosis in 0.8%. There were 2 cases of cardiac and overall death (0.13%). Device-oriented cardiac events occurred in 1% of the patients. In conclusion, our data of consecutive patients suggest that current use of BVS in a wide spectrum of coronary narrowings and clinical settings is associated with good outcome at 30\xc2\xa0days.'"

Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to arm A: trastuzumab 8 mg/kg \xe2\x86\x92 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks plus capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) twice a day (2 weeks on, 1 week off, every 3 weeks); or arm B: pertuzumab 840 mg \xe2\x86\x92 420 mg once every 3 weeks plus trastuzumab at the same dose and schedule as arm A plus capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on the same schedule as arm A. The primary end point was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival (IRF PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and safety. Hierarchical testing procedures were used to control type I error for statistical testing of IRF PFS, OS, and objective response rate. Results Randomly assigned (intent-to-treat) populations were 224 and 228 patients in arms A and B, respectively. Median IRF PFS at 28.6 and 25.3 months' median follow-up was 9.0 v 11.1 months (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02; P = .0731) and interim OS was 28.1 v 36.1 months (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.90). The most common adverse events (all grades; incidence of \xe2\x89\xa5 10% in either arm and \xe2\x89\xa5 5% difference between arms) were hand-foot syndrome, nausea, and neutropenia in arm A, and diarrhea, rash, and nasopharyngitis in arm B. Conclusion The addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and capecitabine did not significantly improve IRF PFS. An 8-month increase in median OS to 36.1 months with pertuzumab was observed. Statistical significance for OS cannot be claimed because of the hierarchical testing of OS after the primary PFS end point; however, the magnitude of OS difference is in keeping with prior experience of pertuzumab in metastatic breast cancer. No new safety signals were identified."""

The aim of the study was to assess prevalence, risk factors for, and effect of anemia on short- and long-term outcomes in HF. The study included 1,394 Caucasian patients hospitalized for HF, with known hemoglobin concentration on hospital admission, participating in 2 HF registries of the European Society of Cardiology (Pilot and Long-Term). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration of <13\xc2\xa0g/dl for men and <12\xc2\xa0g/dl for women. Primary end points were (1) all-cause death at 1\xc2\xa0year and (2) a composite of all-cause death and rehospitalization for HF at 1\xc2\xa0year. Secondary end points included inter alia death during index hospitalization. In addition, we investigated the effect of changes in hemoglobin concentration during hospitalization on prognosis. Anemia occurred in 33% of patients. Predictors of anemia included older age, diabetes, greater New York Heart Association class at hospital admission and kidney disease. During 1-year follow-up, 21% of anemic and 13% of nonanemic patients died (p <0.0001). Combined primary end point occurred in 45% of anemic and in 33% of nonanemic patients (p <0.0001). Anemia was strongly predictive of all the prespecified clinical end points in univariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses.

Given changes in care systems, more persons with dementia will live longer at home. However, living at home (with dementia) with a good quality of life is not easy to achieve. Dementia is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms like apathy, agitation, depression, and anxiety, which have a negative impact on quality of life. Whereas cognitive deterioration can hardly be influenced, it is possible to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms. As autobiographical memories remain intact for a relatively long time in dementia, reminiscence interventions can promote feelings of pleasure and trust. The Online Life Story Book (OLSB) allows to digitally share memories (stories, pictures, video or audio fragments). The main objective is to study the effects of the OLSB on neuropsychiatric symptoms. The study has four secondary objectives: 1) to study the effectiveness of the intervention on the burden and quality of life of the primary informal caregiver; 2) to provide a preliminary health-economic evaluation; 3) to study the (time to) nursing home admittance as a longer term effect; 4) to provide a process evaluation.'"

Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups.

There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

This randomized phase III trial compared lenalidomide as maintenance therapy with placebo in elderly patients with DLBCL who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to R-CHOP induction. Methods Patients with previously untreated DLBCL or other aggressive B-cell lymphoma were 60 to 80 years old, had CR or PR after six or eight cycles of R-CHOP, and were randomly assigned to lenalidomide maintenance 25 mg/d or placebo for 21 days of every 28-day cycle for 24 months. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results A total of 650 patients were randomly assigned. At the time of the primary analysis (December 2015), with a median follow-up of 39 months from random assignment, median PFS was not reached for lenalidomide maintenance versus 58.9 months for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.537 to 0.933; P = .01). The result was consistent among analyzed subgroups (eg, male v female, age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 0 or 1 v 2 or 3, age younger than 70 v \xe2\x89\xa5 70 years), response (PR v CR) after R-CHOP, and positron emission tomography status at assignment (negative v positive). With longer median follow-up of 52 months (October 2016), overall survival was similar between arms (hazard ratio, 1.218; 95% CI, 0.861 to 1.721; P = .26). Most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with lenalidomide versus placebo maintenance were neutropenia (56% v 22%) and cutaneous reactions (5% v 1%), respectively.

The effect of processing and the ability of milk to enhance zinc absorption from other foods has not been measured directly in humans.Objective: We aimed to assess zinc absorption from 1) milk undergoing various processing and preparatory steps and 2) from intrinsically labeled high-phytate rice consumed with milk or water.Methods: Two randomized crossover studies were conducted in healthy young women [age:18-25 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 20-25]: 1) a milk study (n = 19) comparing the consumption of 800 mL full-fat ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk [heat-treated milk (HTM)], full-fat UHT milk diluted 1:1 with water [heat-treated milk and water (MW)], water, or unprocessed (raw) milk (UM), each extrinsically labeled with (67)Zn, and 2) a rice study (n = 18) comparing the consumption of 90 g intrinsically (67)Zn-labeled rice with 600 mL of water [rice and water (RW)] or full-fat UHT milk [rice and milk (RM)]. The fractional absorption of zinc (FAZ) was measured with the double-isotope tracer ratio method. In vitro, we assessed zinc extraction from rice blended into water, UM, or HTM with or without phytate.Results: FAZ from HTM was 25.5% (95% CI: 21.6%, 29.4%) and was not different from UM (27.8%; 95% CI: 24.2%, 31.4%). FAZ from water was higher (72.3%; 95% CI: 68.7%, 75.9%), whereas FAZ from MW was lower (19.7%; 95% CI: 17.5%, 21.9%) than HTM and UM (both P < 0.01). FAZ from RM (20.7%; 95% CI: 18.8%, 22.7%) was significantly higher than from RW (12.8%; 95% CI: 10.8%, 14.6%; P < 0.01). In vitro, HTM and UM showed several orders of magnitude higher extraction of zinc from rice with HTM than from rice with water at various phytate concentrations.Conclusions: Milk enhanced human FAZ from high-phytate rice by 62% compared with water. Diluting milk with water decreases its absorption-enhancing proprieties, whereas UHT processing does not.

Participants were indigenous Guatemalan women of childbearing age whose major food staple was maize and who had been randomly assigned in a larger study to either of 2 ad libitum feeding groups: low-phytate maize (LP; 1.6 mg/g; n = 14) or control maize (C; 7.1 mg/g; n = 8). Total dietary zinc (milligrams per day, TDZ) and phytate (milligrams per day) were determined from duplicate diets and fractional absorption (FAZ) by dual isotope ratio technique (TAZ = TDZ \xc3\x97 FAZ). All variables were examined longitudinally and by group and compared with PRs. TAZ values at later phases were compared with phase 1. Measured TAZ was compared with predicted TAZ for nonpregnant, nonlactating (NPNL) women.Results: TAZ was greater in the LP group than in the C group at all phases. All variables increased from phase 1 to phases 2 and 3 and declined at phase 4. TAZ increased by 1.25 mg/d (P = 0.045) in the C group and by 0.81 mg/d (P = 0.058) in the LP group at phase 2. At phase 3, the increases were 2.66 mg/d (P = 0.002) in the C group and 2.28 mg/d (P = 0.0004) in the LP group, compared with a 1.37-mg/d increase in PR. Measured TAZ was greater than predicted values in phases 2-4.Conclusions: Upregulation of zinc absorption in late pregnancy and early lactation matches increases in PRs of pregnant and lactating women, regardless of dietary phytate, which has implications for dietary zinc requirements of pregnant and lactating women.'"

Less than half of antenatal anemia is considered responsive to iron; identifying women in need of iron may help target interventions. Iron absorption is governed by the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin.Objective: We sought to characterize changes in hepcidin and its associations with indexes of iron stores, erythropoiesis, and inflammation at weeks 14, 20, and 30 of gestation and to assess hepcidin's diagnostic potential as an index of iron deficiency.Methods: We measured hemoglobin and serum hepcidin, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 14, 20, and 30 wk of gestation in a cohort of 395 Gambian women recruited to a randomized controlled trial. Associations with hepcidin were measured by using linear regression, and hepcidin's diagnostic test accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)), sensitivity, specificity, cutoffs] for iron deficiency at each time point was analyzed.Results: The prevalence of anemia increased from 34.6% at 14 wk of gestation to 50.0% at 20 wk. Hepcidin concentrations declined between study enrollment and 20 wk, whereas ferritin declined between 20 and 30 wk of gestation. The variations in hepcidin explained by ferritin, sTfR, and CRP declined over pregnancy. The AUC(ROC) values for hepcidin to detect iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <15 \xce\xbcg/L) were 0.86, 0.83, and 0.84 at 14, 20, and 30 wk, respectively. Hepcidin was superior to hemoglobin and sTfR as an indicator of iron deficiency.Conclusions: In Gambian pregnant women, hepcidin appears to be a useful diagnostic test for iron deficiency and may enable the identification of cases for whom iron would be beneficial. Hepcidin suppression in the second trimester suggests a window for optimal timing for antenatal iron interventions. Hemoglobin does not effectively identify iron deficiency in pregnancy.

Usual nutrient intakes were estimated by repeated 24-h dietary recalls. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 mo. Because of the relation between nutritional status and inflammation, serum C-reactive protein, \xce\xb1-1-acid-glycoprotein, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) were also monitored.Results: Eighty-nine women (47 in the ASF group and 42 controls) completed the study. In the ASF group, intakes of iron and vitamins A and B-12 below the EAR were eliminated, and the prevalence of a low zinc intake was reduced to 9.6% compared with 64.7% in controls (P < 0.001). At 6 mo, a modest increase (P < 0.05) in hemoglobin and iron status occurred in the ASF group compared with the control group, but plasma zinc, retinol, and serum vitamin B-12 concentrations did not differ. UTI relative risk was 3.9 (P < 0.05) among women assigned to the ASF group who had a low whole-body iron status at baseline.Conclusions: Adding a small amount of locally produced ASF to the diets of reproductive-age Vietnamese women improved micronutrient intakes and iron status. However, the increased UTI incidence in women in the ASF group with initially lower iron stores warrants further investigation.'"

However, rodent studies suggest that OCFAs are synthesized endogenously from gut-derived propionate. Propionate increases with dietary fiber consumption and has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.Objective: We hypothesized that OCFAs are produced in humans from dietary fibers by a novel endogenous pathway.Design: In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 16 healthy individuals were supplemented with cellulose (30 g/d), inulin (30 g/d), or propionate (6 g/d) for 7 d. In addition, human hepatoma cells were incubated with different propionate concentrations. OCFAs were determined in plasma phospholipids and hepatoma cells by gas chromatography.Results: Cellulose did not affect plasma OCFA levels, whereas inulin and propionate increased pentadecanoic acid by \xe2\x88\xbc17% (P < 0.05) and 13% (P = 0.05), respectively. The effect on heptadecanoic acid was even more pronounced, because it was elevated in almost all participants by inulin (11%; P < 0.01) and propionate (13%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, cell culture experiments showed a positive association between propionate and OCFA levels (R(2) = 0.99, P < 0.0001), whereas palmitate (16:0) was negatively correlated (R(2) = 0.83, P = 0.004).Conclusions: Our data show that gut-derived propionate is used for the hepatic synthesis of OCFAs in humans. The association of OCFAs with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes may therefore also relate to dietary fiber intake and not only dairy fat.

The MedDiet comprised mainly plant foods, abundant extra-virgin olive oil, and minimal red meat and processed foods.

Most of these programs focus primarily on down-regulating negative affectivity, rather than increasing strengths and up-regulating positive affectivity. The data suggest the existence of disturbances in positive affectivity in these disorders, and so new interventions focusing on these problems are greatly needed.

In this work, the immune system of ipilimumab treated patients was monitored to investigate potential mechanisms of action that may correlate with treatment outcome. Blood samples from 43 advanced melanoma patients were taken before, during and at the end of treatment. Hematological parameters were measured and flow cytometry analysis was performed in fresh samples within two hours of sample collection. Strong differences in markers CD45RA, CCR7, HLA-DR and CD15 between fresh and cryopreserved samples were observed. Ipilimumab treatment increased absolute lymphocyte counts, eosinophils, effector T cells and their activation status, whilst diminishing the suppressive side of the immune response, acting on regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These effects were visible after one ipilimumab infusion and, regarding eosinophil counts, correlated with onset of adverse events. Monocytic MDSCs were decreased in response to treatment only in patients with clinical benefit; additionally, patients with a lower frequency of these cells after the first ipilimumab infusion experienced increased overall survival. CD8 effector memory T cell frequencies at the end of treatment were higher in patients with clinical benefit and positively correlated with survival. These data show that a clinical response to ipilimumab not only requires reshaping T cell populations, but additionally involves a reduction in suppressive cells such as monocytic MDSCs.

HIIT acutely increases plasma lactate levels. This may be important, since the administration of lactate during hypoglycemia suppresses symptoms and counterregulation while preserving cognitive function. We tested the hypothesis that, in the short term, HIIT reduces awareness of hypoglycemia and attenuates hypoglycemia-induced cognitive dysfunction. In a randomized crossover trial, patients with type 1 diabetes and normal awareness of hypoglycemia (NAH), patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH), and healthy participants (n = 10 per group) underwent a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic (2.6 mmol/L) clamp, either after a HIIT session or after seated rest. Compared with rest, HIIT reduced symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients with NAH but not in healthy participants or patients with IAH. HIIT attenuated hypoglycemia-induced cognitive dysfunction, which was mainly driven by changes in the NAH subgroup. HIIT suppressed cortisol and growth hormone responses, but not catecholamine responses to hypoglycemia. The present findings demonstrate that a single HIIT session rapidly reduces awareness of subsequent hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and NAH, but does not in patients with IAH, and attenuates hypoglycemia-induced cognitive dysfunction. The role of exercise-induced lactate in mediating these effects, potentially serving as an alternative fuel for the brain, should be further explored.'"

Conversely, potassium likely elicits favorable effects against cardiovascular disorders. Gastrin, which is produced by the G-cells of the stomach and duodenum, can increase renal sodium excretion and regulate blood pressure by acting on the cholecystokinin B receptor. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of altered salt and potassium supplementation on serum gastrin levels in humans. A total of 44 subjects (38-65 years old) were selected from a rural community in northern China. All subjects were sequentially maintained on a relatively low-salt diet for 7 days (3.0 g/day of NaCl), a high-salt diet for 7 days (18.0 g/day of NaCl), and then a high-salt diet supplemented with potassium for another 7 days (18.0 g/day of NaCl + 4.5 g/day of KCl). The high-salt intake significantly increased serum gastrin levels (15.3 \xc2\xb1 0.3 vs. 17.6 \xc2\xb1 0.3 pmol/L). This phenomenon was alleviated through potassium supplementation (17.6 \xc2\xb1 0.3 vs. 16.5 \xc2\xb1 0.4 pmol/L). Further analyses revealed that serum gastrin was positively correlated with 24 h urinary sodium excretion (r = 0.476, p < 0.001). By contrast, gastrin level was negatively correlated with blood pressure in all dietary interventions (r = -0.188, p = 0.031).

Methods We recruited 212 low-income, predominantly Latina (72.6%) survivors with stage 0 to III breast cancer, with an average age of 53 years, from two Los Angeles County public hospitals into an RCT of a survivorship care nurse counseling session coupled with the provision of individualized treatment summaries and survivorship care plans to patients and their health care providers from December 2012 to July 2014. One hundred seven survivors received the experimental intervention, and 105 survivors received usual care. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess intervention effects on physician implementation of and patient adherence to recommended survivorship care. Scales that served as covariables were Knowledge of Survivorship Issues, Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions, and Satisfaction With Care and Information. Results Survivors in the intervention group reported greater physician implementation of recommended breast cancer survivorship care, for example, treatment of depression or hot flashes, than did those in the control group (adjusted difference, 16 \xc2\xb1 5.3; P = .003). Baseline Satisfaction With Care and Information was positively associated with physician implementation (coefficient, 5.2 \xc2\xb1 2.2; P = .02).

Long-term follow-up is important to judge both efficacy and safety of the different therapies used. Patients and Methods We analyzed updated follow-up data on 4,276 patients treated within the German Hodgkin Study Group trials HD7 and HD10 for early-stage favorable HL and HD8 and HD11 for early-stage unfavorable HL between 1993 and 2003. Results In HD7 (N = 627; median follow-up, 120 months), combined-modality treatment was superior to extended-field radiotherapy (RT), with 15-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 73% versus 52% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.6; P < .001), without differences in overall survival (OS). In HD10 (N = 1,190; median follow-up, 98 months), noninferiority of two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) plus 20 Gy involved-field (IF)-RT to more intensive four cycles of ABVD plus 30 Gy IF-RT was confirmed with 10-year PFS of 87% each (HR, 1.0; 95%, 0.6 to 1.5) and OS of 94% each (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.6), respectively. In both trials, no differences in second neoplasias were observed. In HD8 (N = 1,064; median follow-up, 153 months), noninferiority of involved-field RT to extended-field RT regarding PFS was confirmed (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.2). In HD11 (N = 1,395; median follow-up, 106 months), superiority of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone at baseline over ABVD was not observed. After BEACOPPbaseline, 20 Gy IF-RT was noninferior to 30 Gy (10-year PFS, 84% v 84%; HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.5). In contrast, PFS was inferior in ABVD-treated patients receiving 20 Gy instead of 30 Gy IF-RT (10-year PFS, 76% v 84%; HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.1). No differences in OS or second neoplasias were observed in in both trials. Conclusion Long-term follow-up data of the four randomized trials largely support the current risk-adapted therapeutic strategies in early-stage HL. Nevertheless, continued follow-up is necessary to assess the long-term safety of currently applied therapeutic strategies.'"

In a randomized clinical trial, we evaluated such a stem (MS-30), which was initially introduced with a solid centralizer but was later recommended to be fitted with a hollow centralizer. We hypothesized that while the stem would sink more, it would become rotationally stable and have less retroversion with a hollow centralizer than with a solid centralizer. Patients and methods - We randomized 60 patients with primary hip arthritis to receive either a hollow centralizer or a solid centralizer with the stem. The effect was evaluated over a 10-year follow-up period with repeated RSA examinations, conventional radiographs, and clinical follow-ups using the WOMAC and SF-12 questionnaires. Results - At 10-year follow-up, the group with hollow centralizers had subsided more than the group with solid centralizers (1.99\xe2\x80\x89mm (hollow) as opposed to 0.57\xe2\x80\x89mm (solid); p < 0.001). However, rotation was similar at 10-year follow-up (mean retroversion 1.34\xc2\xb0 (hollow) and 1.30\xc2\xb0 (solid)). Both groups showed excellent 10-year results, with similar clinical outcome, and none of the stems were radiographically loose or had been revised. Interpretation - As expected, there was more subsidence in the group with hollow centralizers, and with similar magnitude to that reported in earlier RSA studies on conceptually similar prostheses. Interestingly, there was no difference in the rotational behavior of the prostheses. This stem type appears to have a design that, regardless of the type of centralizer and the possibility of subsidence, withstands the rotational forces it is subjected to very well. This study does not support the need for a hollow centralizer for these types of stems.'"

Acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 can cause relapse, but data regarding the prevalence and natural history of these mutations are limited. Patients and Methods Patients accrued to four sequential studies of ibrutinib were included in these analyses. Deep sequencing for BTK and PLCG2 was performed retrospectively on patients who experienced relapse and prospectively on a screening population. Results With a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, the estimated cumulative incidence of progression at 4 years is 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%). Baseline karyotypic complexity, presence of del(17)(p13.1), and age less than 65 years were risk factors for progression. Among patients who experienced relapse, acquired mutations of BTK or PLCG2 were found in 85% (95% CI, 71% to 94%), and these mutations were detected an estimated median of 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 11.7 months) before relapse. Of a group of 112 patients examined prospectively, eight patients have experienced relapse, and all of these patients had acquired resistance mutations before relapse. A resistance mutation was detected in an additional eight patients who have not yet met criteria for clinical relapse. Conclusion Relapse of chronic lymphocytic leukemia after ibrutinib is an issue of increasing clinical significance. We show that mutations in BTK and PLCG2 appear early and have the potential to be used as a biomarker for future relapse, suggesting an opportunity for intervention.'"

Resistant starch (RS), a NDC, positively modulates the expression of oncogenic microRNAs, suggesting that this could be a mechanism through which NDCs protect against CRC. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of supplementation with two NDCs, RS, and polydextrose (PD), on microRNA expression in the macroscopically-normal human rectal epithelium using samples from the DISC Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention. We screened 1008 miRNAs in pooled post-intervention rectal mucosal samples from participants allocated to the double placebo group and those supplemented with both RS and PD. A total of 111 miRNAs were up- or down-regulated by at least twofold in the RS\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89PD group compared with the control group. From these, eight were selected for quantification in individual participant samples by qPCR, and fold-change direction was consistent with the array for seven miRNAs. The inconsistency for miR-133b and the lower fold-change values observed for the seven miRNAs is probably because qPCR of individual participant samples is a more robust and sensitive method of quantification than the array. miR-32 expression was increased by approximately threefold (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.033) in the rectal mucosa of participants supplemented with RS\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89PD compared with placebo. miR-32 is involved in the regulation of processes such as cell proliferation that are dysregulated in CRC.

A 3-d-list-discrimination procedure, based on free recall of objects, with a contextual reminder cue (the testing room), has been thought to demonstrate reconsolidation of human episodic memory (as noted in a previous study). Our goal was to replicate the central result, a high intrusion rate during recall of the target list, and evaluate the reconsolidation account relative to an alternative account, based on state-dependent learning and interference. First, replication was not straightforward (Experiment 1). Second, using a very unique, highly salient context (Experiment 2), the method produced a qualitative replication, but it was small in magnitude. A critical assumption of the reconsolidation account, that the target list is reactivated and destabilized during re-exposure to the study context, was not supported (Experiment 3). Although troubling for the reconsolidation account, the findings can be easily accommodated by an alternative account that does not assume additional neurobiological processes underlying the destabilization of consolidated memories, instead explaining intrusion rates simply in terms of well-established cognitive effects, such as item-to-context binding and interference during retrieval.'"

Dexmedetomidine and propofol dosages were adjusted to maintain the targeted level of sedation. Results After administration of sedative drugs, patients who received dexmedetomidine had a significantly lower heart rate. The intraoperative requirement of fentanyl was significantly lower in patients who received dexmedetomidine compared with patients who received propofol. Administration of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced postoperative pain score, longer time for onset of sedation, and a slightly longer recovery time. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. The patients' overall satisfaction score was comparable between the two groups. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine is an effective adjuvant when co-administered with fentanyl for conscious sedation in patients who undergo inguinal hernia repair. Administration of dexmedetomidine decreases the requirement of fentanyl and the pain score, but slightly prolongs the time to sedation and recovery."""

However, localized biomechanical vibration has not received the same attention. The purpose of this study was to assess peak and average power before and after acute vibration of selected lower-body sites in division I athletes. Twenty-one subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions using a cross-over design. Pretest consisted of a counter-movement vertical jump (VJ) followed by either localized vibration (30 Hz) to 4 selected lower-body areas or 4 minutes of moderately low-resistance stationary cycling (70 rpm). Vibration consisted of 1 minute bouts at each lower-leg site for a total of 4 minutes followed by an immediate post-test VJ. Repeated measures analysis of variance yielded no significant differences (p > 0.05) in either peak power or peak velocity. Similarly, no significant differences were found for average power and velocity between conditions. It should be noted that, while not significant, the vibration condition demonstrated an increase in peak power and velocity while the bike condition registered slight decreases. Comparing each of the post-VJ repetitions (1, 2, and 3) the vibration condition experienced significantly greater peak power and velocity from VJ 1 to VJ 3 compared with the bike condition which demonstrated no significant differences among the post-test VJs. These results yielded similar, although not statistically significant outcomes to previous studies using WBV. However, the novelty of selected site biomechanical vibration merits further investigation with respect to frequency, magnitude, and duration of vibration.'"

DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS 41 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES After collection of baseline clinical and historical data, dogs were randomly assigned to receive topically applied undiluted heterologous serum (n = 22) or isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (19) along with tobramycin and atropine. Epithelial debridement (at all visits) and grid keratotomy (at visits 2, 3, and 4) of SCCEDs were performed. Ophthalmic examination including fluorescein application was performed once weekly for 4 weeks or until corneal reepithelialization. Clinicians and owners were masked to treatment group. RESULTS No differences in baseline data were detected between treatment groups. No difficulties with medication administration, noncompliance, or adverse reactions were noted. All SCCEDs in both groups healed by 4 weeks after treatment began. Median time to reepithelialization (2 weeks) was not significantly different between serum-treated and placebo-treated eyes. Irrespective of treatment group, median time to reepithelialization was not significantly different for Boxers versus non-Boxer breeds. Direct correlations were detected between time to reepithelialization and vascularization score at study entry, vascularization score at time of reepithelialization, and ulcer area at study entry in both groups. Time to reepithelialization was not correlated with age, sex, or duration of signs in either group.

Venous blood was collected for the quantification of plasma (R)-(-)-methadone, LAAM, and nor-LAAM concentrations. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Trail-Making Test were administered at the time of peak plasma concentration. Ten healthy controls (HCs) also participated. OSPAT scores (obtained for 15 patients) fluctuated significantly across the dosing-interval for both drugs and were lower in patients than HCs at the times of peak concentrations of (R)-(-)-methadone (1 hr: (mean difference; 95% CI) (2.13; 0.18-4.08); 2 hrs: (2.38; 0.48-4.28) postdosing) and LAAM (2 hrs: (1.81; 0.09-3.53), and 4 hrs (1.90: 0.9-3.71) postdosing).

Current vaccine programs using live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have numerous drawbacks. As an alternative solution to control IBD, a Marek's disease virus (MDV) vector vaccine (rMDV-VP2) expressing the VP2 gene of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has been developed. In this study, the protective efficacy of rMDV-VP2 was evaluated in a dose-related experiment which showed that a single dose of 1000 PFU was sufficient to fully protect chickens against IBDV infection. Chickens inoculated with lower doses of rMDV-VP2 (250 or 500 PFU) conferred 80 and 90% protection against IBDV. Next, rMDV-VP2 vaccine provided 90% protection against IBDV in commercial layer chickens with maternal antibodies, which was higher than the protective efficacy using the B87 live vaccine of IBDV. Additionally, rMDV-VP2 conferred effective protection against very virulent MDV challenge in chickens (95% for chickens vaccinated with 250 or 500 PFU and 100% for chickens vaccinated with 1000 or 2000 PFU). These results demonstrated that rMDV-VP2 may be a novel bivalent vaccine against IBD and Marek's disease in chickens."""

Continuous consumption of CGA reduces body fat and body weight. Since energy metabolism and sleep are controlled by common regulatory factors, consumption of CGA might modulate sleep. Lack of sleep has been identified as a risk factor for obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting CGA over 5 d on energy metabolism and sleep quality in humans. A total of nine healthy subjects (four male and five female) completed a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over intervention study. Subjects consumed a test beverage containing 0 or 600 mg of CGA for 5 d. On the fifth night, subjects stayed in a whole-room metabolic chamber to measure energy metabolism; sleep was evaluated using polysomnographic recording. It was found that CGA shortened sleep latency (9 (sem 2) v. 16 (sem 4) min, P<0\xc2\xb705) compared with the control, whereas no effect on sleep architecture, such as slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement or waking after sleep onset, was observed. Indirect calorimetry revealed that consumption of CGA increased fat oxidation (510 (sem 84) kJ/8 h (122 (sem 20) kcal/8 h) v. 331 (sem 79) kJ/8 h (81 (sem 19) kcal/8 h), P<0\xc2\xb705) but did not affect energy expenditure during sleep. Consumption of CGA enhanced parasympathetic activity assessed from heart-rate variability during sleep (999 (sem 77) v. 919 (sem 54), P<0\xc2\xb705). A period of 5-d CGA consumption significantly increased fat oxidation during sleep, suggesting that beverages containing CGA may be beneficial to reduce body fat and prevent obesity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly divided 981 healthy Chinese men into groups according to research-set bedtimes (A=8-10 PM, B=after 10 PM, and C=after midnight) and sleep durations: group 1=<6.0 h (short), group 2=7.0-8.0 h (average), and group 3=>9.0 h (long). Sperm morphology, count, survival, and motility were examined according to sleep patterns. Antisperm antibody (ASA) production in semen was determined. RESULTS Sperm counts and their survival rates were lower in the short sleepers as compared to others within each group (all P<0.01). The lower counts and survival rates were observed in different bedtimes, with significant differences found between measurements of C1 vs. A1 and C2 vs. A2 or B2 (all P<0.05 or 0.01). Semen motility was lower in the short sleepers as compared to the average and long sleepers (all P<0.01). There were differences in the bedtime-related results between measurements of C1 vs. A1 or B1 (P<0.05 or 0.01). Additionally, the population proportion for the ASA-positive participates and incidence of the ASA-expressed population obviously increased in the short sleepers as compared to others within each group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Short and long sleep durations and late bedtime were associated with impaired sperm health in the study cohort, partly through increasing ASA production in the semen.'"

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there was a difference in long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes between the patients treated with and those treated without a TLSO. Here, the authors present the 5- to 10-year outcomes (mean follow-up 7.9 \xc2\xb1 1.1 years) of the patients at a single site from the original multicenter trial. METHODS Between July 2002 and January 2009, a total of 96 subjects were enrolled in the primary trial and randomized to two groups: TLSO or NO. Subjects were enrolled if they had an AO Type A3 burst fracture between T-10 and L-3 within the previous 72 hours, kyphotic deformity < 35\xc2\xb0, no neurological deficit, and an age of 16-60 years old. The present study represents a subset of those patients: 16 in the TLSO group and 20 in the NO group. The primary outcome measure was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at the last 5- to 10-year follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included kyphosis, satisfaction, the Numeric Rating Scale for back pain, and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Mental and Physical Component Summary (MCS and PCS) scores. In the original study, outcome measures were administered at admission and 2 and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after injury; in the present extended follow-up study, the outcome measures were administered 5-10 years postinjury. Treatment comparison between patients in the TLSO group and those in the NO group was performed at the latest available follow-up, and the time-weighted average treatment effect was determined using a mixed-effects model of longitudinal regression for repeated measures averaged over all time periods. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and were replaced with a set of plausible values derived using a multiple imputation procedure. RESULTS The RMDQ score at 5-10 years postinjury was 3.6 \xc2\xb1 0.9 (mean \xc2\xb1 SE) for the TLSO group and 4.8 \xc2\xb1 1.5 for the NO group (p = 0.486, 95% CI -2.3 to 4.8). Average kyphosis was 18.3\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb1 2.2\xc2\xb0 for the TLSO group and 18.6\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb1 3.8\xc2\xb0 for the NO group (p = 0.934, 95% CI -7.8 to 8.5).

Similarly, threat responses acquired during Pavlovian threat conditioning often return after extinction learning. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative methods to persistently reduce threat responding. Studies in rodents have suggested that exercising behavioral control over an aversive stimulus can persistently diminish threat responses, and that these effects are mediated by the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and striatum. In this fMRI study, we attempted to translate these findings to humans. Subjects first underwent threat conditioning. We then contrasted two forms of safety learning: active avoidance, in which participants could prevent the shock through an action, and yoked extinction, with shock presentation matched to the active condition, but without instrumental control. The following day, we assessed subjects' threat responses (measured by skin conductance) to the conditioned stimuli without shock. Subjects next underwent threat conditioning with novel stimuli. Yoked extinction subjects showed an increase in conditioned response to stimuli from the previous day, but the active avoidance group did not. Additionally, active avoidance subjects showed reduced conditioned responding during novel threat conditioning, but the extinction group did not. We observed between-group differences in striatal BOLD responses to shock omission in Avoidance/Extinction. These findings suggest a differential role for the striatum in human active avoidance versus extinction learning, and indicate that active avoidance may be more effective than extinction in persistently diminishing threat responses.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Extinguished threat responses often reemerge with time, highlighting the importance of identifying more enduring means of attenuation. We compared the effects of active avoidance learning and yoked extinction on threat responses in humans and contrasted the neural circuitry engaged by these two processes. Subjects who learned to prevent a shock through an action maintained low threat responses after safety learning and showed attenuated threat conditioning with novel stimuli, in contrast to those who underwent yoked extinction. The results suggest that experiences of active control over threat engage the striatum and promote a shift from expression of innate defensive responses toward more adaptive behavioral responses to threatening stimuli."""

A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled, prospective multicenter study was conducted in 11 cities in China. Treatment-naive patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis were randomly assigned to one of three arms for a 14-day treatment: Arm A triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, each twice daily) plus polaprezinc 75 mg twice daily; Arm B triple therapy plus polaprezinc 150 mg twice daily, or Arm C triple therapy alone. The rate of H. pylori eradication was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were symptom improvement and lower incidence of adverse events. 303 patients completed the study- 106, 96, and 101 patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (77.0%) and B (75.9%) compared to Arm C (58.6%) (P < 0.01), whereas there was no difference between Arms A and B (P = 0.90). Per-protocol (PP) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (81.1%) and B (83.3%) compared to Arm C (61.4%) (P < 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference between Arms A and B (P = 0.62). All three groups reported significant symptom improvement at 7, 14, and 28 days after treatment, compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). The adverse event rate for Arm B (5.1%) was higher than for Arms A (2.8%) (P = 0.04) and C (1.9%) (P = 0.02). There were no serious adverse events in any group.

During retention, significant error reduction was found in the retention set at 1 h for both exercise groups, but this enhancement was not present during subsequent retention sets, with no differences present between exercise groups.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This single-center, randomized, controlled study was conducted in Istanbul, Turkey between June 2014 and April 2015. Among 115 eligible OSA patients (mean age 51.0\xc2\xb19.3 years; 75.5% men), 63 were randomized to standard support (SS) group (general information about OSA and PAP treatment at baseline), and 52 to educational support (ES) group (additional polysomnography chart viewing from both diagnostic and titration nights). All patients were scheduled to five PAP control visits between two weeks and six months after the PAP prescription. Primary outcome was the PAP compliance (4 hours/night for 70% of all the nights) at the last visit. RESULTS Average PAP usage was 4.2\xc2\xb12.5 hours/night in the SS group, and 5.2\xc2\xb12.1 hours/night in the ES group (p=0.027). PAP compliance was achieved among 68.3% in the SS group, and 86.5% in the ES group (p=0.021). In a multivariate analysis, ES strategy followed by frequent visits predicted PAP compliance (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-10.6; p=0.020). Other predictors were obesity (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.7; p=0.019) and severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index \xe2\x89\xa530/hour) at baseline (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.2-17.6; p=0.023). Primary school education level was inversely related with PAP compliance (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS Patient education with polysomnography chart view followed by frequent visits increased long-term compliance with PAP treatment.'"

Between December 2006 and December 2014, 53\xc2\xa0patients with NMIBC who underwent TUR were randomly assigned to receive BHPC (BHPC group, 28\xc2\xa0patients) or intravesical chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group, 25\xc2\xa0patients) at the Intracelom Hyperthermic Perfusion Therapy Center of Guangzhou Medical University Cancer Hospital (Guangzhou, China). BHPC was performed by combining perfusion-based hyperthermia with chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin\xc2\xa0C (MMC) in the bladder, and the chemotherapy group of patients received bladder MMC perfusion. The concentration of MMC in the perfusion fluid and serum were assessed at different time-points. Tumor recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and side-effects were recorded and compared between the 2\xc2\xa0groups. Results revealed that BHPC was performed smoothly, at ~44\xcc\x8aC in the bladder cavity. Patients tolerated BHPC, and no side-effects were observed. Both BHPC and intravesical chemotherapy achieved a high MMC concentration in the bladder perfusion liquid, but low MMC concentration in the serum, although serum MMC concentrations in the BHPC group were significantly higher (P<0.05). The tumor recurrence rate was significantly lower (10.7\xc2\xa0vs. 28.0%; P=0.02) and the DFS period was significantly longer (37\xc2\xb11.2 vs. 19\xc2\xb10.9\xc2\xa0months; P=0.001) in the BHPC group than in the chemotherapy group.

PLW in intervention facilities received enhanced nutrition counseling at health clinics, were linked with community-based maternal support groups, and received vouchers for OFSP vine cuttings. Control PLW received clinic-based nutrition counseling only. A total of 505 women in early and midpregnancy, attending their first antenatal care visit, and with no previous engagement in project activities were enrolled from the 8 facilities. Nutrition and health-seeking knowledge, food security, dietary patterns, and anthropometric measurements were collected at 4 time points at \xe2\x89\xa49 mo postpartum. VA intakes were assessed with multipass 24-h recalls in a subsample of 206 mothers at 8-10 mo postpartum. VA status was assessed by using serum retinol-binding protein (RBP). Impacts were estimated with multilevel mixed models adjusted for clustering and differences at enrollment.Results: At enrollment, 22.9% of women had RBP <1.17 \xce\xbcmol/L.

White spot lesions are observed in nearly 50% of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The use of fluoride-containing orthodontic materials has shown inconclusive results on their ability to reduce decalcification. The aims of this investigation were to compare the levels of Streptococcus mutans (SM) in saliva and biofilm adjacent to orthodontic brackets retained with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) (Fuji ORTHO LC) and a light cured composite resin (Transbond XT), and to analyze the influence of topical application of the 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) on SM counts. In a parallel study design, two groups (n=14/15) were used with random allocation and high salivary SM counts before treatment. Biofilm was collected from areas adjacent to the brackets on teeth 13, 22, 33, and 41. Both saliva and biofilm were collected on the 7th, 21st, 35th, and 49th days after appliance placement. Topical fluoride application was carried out on the 35th day. Bonding with RMGIC did not alter SM counts in saliva or biofilm adjacent to the brackets. On the other hand, the biofilm adjacent to brackets retained with composite resin showed a significant increase in SM counts along the trial period. Topical application of 1.23% APF did not reduce salivary or biofilm SM counts regardless of the bonding material. In conclusion, fluoride topical application did not show efficacy in reducing SM. The use of RMGIC as bonding materials allowed a better control of SM cfu counts in dental biofilm hindering the significant increase of these microorganisms along the trial period, which was observed in the biofilm adjacent to the composite material.'"

We hypothesized that receiving a message advertising that ""you will be able to see your baby by ultrasound"" would motivate rural Ugandan women who otherwise might use a traditional birth attendant to attend antenatal care, and that those women would subsequently be more satisfied with care. A cluster randomized trial was conducted across eight rural sub-counties in southwestern Uganda. Sub-counties were randomized to a control arm, with advertisement of antenatal care with no mention of portable obstetric ultrasound (four communities, n = 59), or an intervention arm, with advertisement of portable obstetric ultrasound. Advertisement of portable obstetric ultrasound was further divided into intervention A) word of mouth advertisement of portable obstetric ultrasound and antenatal care (one communitity, n = 16), B) radio advertisement of only antenatal care and word of mouth advertisement of antenatal care and portable obstetric ultrasound (one community, n = 7), or C) word of mouth + radio advertisement of both antenatal care and portable obstetric ultrasound (two communities, n = 75). The primary outcome was attendance to antenatal care. 159 women presented to antenatal care across eight sub-counties. The rate of attendance was 65.1 (per 1000 pregnant women, 95% CI 38.3-110.4) where portable obstetric ultrasound was advertised by radio and word of mouth, as compared to a rate of 11.1 (95% CI 6.1-20.1) in control communities (rate ratio 5.9, 95% CI 2.6-13.0, p<0.0001). Attendance was also improved in women who had previously seen a traditional healer (13.0, 95% CI 5.4-31.2) compared to control (1.5, 95% CI 0.5-5.0, rate ratio 8.7, 95% CI 2.0-38.1, p = 0.004).

Patients and Methods This randomized (1:1) open-label phase II trial compared the efficacy of pazopanib 800 mg orally with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) in the second-line setting. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Results Between August 2012 and October 2014, 131 patients, out of 140 planned, were randomly assigned. The study was terminated early on the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee because of futility. Final analysis after the preplanned number of deaths (n = 110) occurred after a median follow-up of 18 months. One hundred fifteen deaths had occurred at the final data extract presented here. Median OS was 8.0 months for paclitaxel (80% CI, 6.9 to 9.7 months) and 4.7 months for pazopanib (80% CI, 4.2 to 6.4 months). The hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for baseline stratification factors was 1.28 (80% CI, 0.99 to 1.67; one-sided P = .89). Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months for paclitaxel (80% CI, 3.0 to 5.6 months) and 3.1 months for pazopanib (80% CI, 2.7 to 4.6 months; HR, 1.09; 80% CI, 0.85 to 1.40; one-sided P = .67). Discontinuations for toxicity occurred in 7.8% and 23.1% for paclitaxel and pazopanib, respectively. Conclusion Pazopanib did not have greater efficacy than paclitaxel in the second-line treatment of urothelial cancers. There was a trend toward superior OS for paclitaxel.'"

The results indicated that, compared to controls (n = 52), both infant disorganization and disrupted maternal communication were significantly reduced in the intervention group (n = 65) that received regular home-visiting during pregnancy and the first year of life. Furthermore, reductions in disrupted maternal communication partially accounted for the observed reductions in infant disorganization compared to randomized controls.

Intent to treat analyses revealed a main effect for maternal response to child distress, with mothers assigned to COS-P reporting fewer unsupportive (but not more supportive) responses to distress than control group mothers, and a main effect for one dimension of child executive functioning (inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility when maternal age and marital status were controlled), with intervention group children showing greater control. There were, however, no main effects of intervention for child attachment or behavior problems. Exploratory follow-up analyses suggested intervention effects were moderated by maternal attachment style or depressive symptoms, with moderated intervention effects emerging for child attachment security and disorganization, but not avoidance; for inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility; and for child internalizing but not externalizing behavior problems. This initial randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of COS-P sets the stage for further exploration of ""what works for whom"" in attachment intervention.'"

Results showed that following the 8-week intervention, scores for maternal sensitivity and child mental and psychomotor development were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. The intervention appears to have no effect on self-reports of stress. All parents report lower levels of stress postintervention; however, when defensive responding is not considered (i.e., extremely low score of parental stress), parents in the control group report somewhat lower scores, raising questions as to the significance of this finding. Considering the small nature of our sample, replication of the present results is needed. Nevertheless, the present findings contribute to the burgeoning literature suggesting that the early attachment relationship provides an important context that influences developmental outcome in different spheres and raises questions as to how such intervention strategies may or may not affect the subjective experience of parenting.'"

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the state of mind rating scales loaded on two factors reflecting adults' preoccupied and dismissing states of mind. Taxometric analyses indicated the variation in adults' preoccupied states of mind was more consistent with a dimensional than a categorical model, whereas results for dismissing states of mind were indeterminate. The second aim was to examine the degree to which the attachment states of mind of internationally adoptive and foster parents differ from those of poverty/CPS-referred parents and low-risk parents. After controlling for parental age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, (a) internationally adoptive parents had lower scores on the dismissing dimension than the sample of community parents described by Haltigan, Leerkes, Supple, and Calkins (2014); (b) foster parents did not differ from community parents on either the dismissing or the preoccupied AAI dimension; and (c) both internationally adoptive and foster parents had lower scores on the preoccupied dimension than poverty/CPS-referred parents. Analyses using the traditional AAI categories provided convergent evidence that (a) internationally adoptive parents were more likely to be classified as having an autonomous state of mind than low-risk North American mothers based on Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn's (2009) meta-analytic estimates, (b) the rates of autonomous states of mind did not differ between foster and low-risk parents, and"""

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing vasculitis received placebo plus prednisone starting at 60 mg daily (control group), avacopan (30 mg, twice daily) plus reduced-dose prednisone (20 mg daily), or avacopan (30 mg, twice daily) without prednisone.

The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients achieving a \xe2\x89\xa550% reduction in Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score by week 12 and no worsening in any body system. We enrolled 67 patients, 23 in the control and 22 in each of the avacopan groups.

This study assessed the effects of implementing an intensive 10-day health promotion program combining diet and physical activities on body composition, physical fitness, and biochemical parameters of young adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this randomized pilot study, 30 female undergraduate students were randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. The health promotion program consisted of unlimited amounts of vegetarian food; aerobic, flexibility, and strength exercises (3 hours/day); lectures on health (3 hours/day); massage practice (2 hours/day); and healthy cooking practice (1 hour/day). The effects of the intervention were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS The intensive 10-day health promotion program significantly reduced body weight, body mass index, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. At the same time, participants demonstrated increased back muscle, leg muscle, and grip strength; waist and shoulder flexibility; balance; and cardiorespiratory endurance. CONCLUSIONS The intensive 10-day health promotion program is a viable intervention for improving body composition, physical fitness, glycemic control, and blood lipid levels in young adults.'"

However, activity of TC relative to AC regimens with a taxane (TaxAC) is unknown. Methods In a series of three adjuvant trials, women were randomly assigned to TC for six cycles (TC6) or to a standard TaxAC regimen. US Oncology Research (USOR) 06-090 compared TC6 with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC6). National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-46-I/USOR 07132 compared TC6, TAC6, or TC6 plus bevacizumab. NSABP B-49 compared TC6 with several standard AC and taxane combination regimens. Before any analysis of individual trials, a joint efficacy analysis of TC versus the TaxAC regimens was planned, with invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) as the primary end point. Patients who received TC6 plus bevacizumab on NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132 were not included. A hazard ratio (HR) from a stratified Cox model that exceeded 1.18 for TC6 versus TaxAC was predefined as inferiority for TC6. The prespecified interim monitoring plan was to report for futility if the HR was > 1.18 when 334 IDFS events were observed (50% of 668 events required for definitive analysis). Results A total of 2,125 patients were randomly assigned to receive TC6 regimens and 2,117 patients were randomly assigned to receive TaxAC regimens. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years. There were 334 IDFS events, and the HR for TC6 versus TaxAC was 1.202 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.49), which triggered early reporting for futility. The 4-year IDFS was 88.2% for TC6 and was 90.7% for TaxAC ( P = .04). Tests for treatment interaction by protocol, hormone receptor status, and nodal status were negative. Conclusion The TaxAC regimens improved IDFS in patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer compared with the TC6 regimen.'"

Cox regression was used to examine the risk of each outcome associated with AF. Over a median follow-up of 3.4\xc2\xa0years, AF was associated with an increased risk for hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34 to 1.66), hospitalization for heart failure (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.81), stroke (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.09), death (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47), and cardiovascular death (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.65). The association between AF and hospitalization was stronger in women (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.91) than men (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.58; p-interaction\xc2\xa0= 0.032). Although significant interactions were not observed for the other outcomes, we appreciated that the risk estimates were higher for women compared with men.

This multicenter prospective cohort study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of pretherapeutic screening for DPD deficiency using a multiparametric approach. Two parallel cohorts of patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma were compared in a prospective nonrandomized study. In arm A, patients had DPD deficiency screening before treatment, whereas in arm B no pretherapy screening was performed. Dosing was based on 5-FU administration guidelines of each institution. DPD deficiency screening was performed using a combined multiparametric approach (5-FU(ODPM Tox)). The frequency of early grade 4-5 toxic events potentially induced by 5-FU was compared in the two groups. At total of 1,142 patients (n = 1,116 evaluable) were enrolled. In arm A, out of 718 evaluable patients, nine grade 4 early toxicities potentially related to 5-FU were reported in nine patients (1.2%) with no toxic death despite one complete DPD deficiency and 24 partial deficiencies. The 24 patients with partial deficiency had safe pharmacokinetics (PK)-monitored 5-FU. In arm B, among 398 evaluable patients, 17 grade 4-5 toxic early events potentially related to 5-FU were reported in 12 patients (4.2%). The incidence of early severe toxicity was significantly higher in arm B (P = .0019), confirming the positive impact of pretherapeutic DPD assessment. The percent of patients with a toxicity grade 3 or higher observed in arm A\xc2\xa0was 10.8% (n = 78) compared to 17.55% (n = 69)\xc2\xa0 in arm B (P = .0497). The percentage of death was reduced from 2.5/1,000 in arm B to 0 in arm A. The time to occurrence of all grade \xe2\x89\xa53 toxicities was determined in both arms and the difference between the two arms was significant (P = .047). Overall, one patient with complete DPD deficiency confirmed retrospectively died within 13 days from grade 5 multivisceral toxicity. Enrollment was prematurely closed after external experts' decision. In conclusion, multiparametric pretherapeutic DPD deficiency screening significantly lowered the risk of early severe toxicity and avoided an early toxic death. This approach should be used for safe administration of 5-FU-based treatments."""

The spot-on formulation was administered at the commercial dose range of 6.0-12.0mg selamectin and 1.0-2.0mg sarolaner per kg bodyweight. In the flea study, the improvement in clinical signs associated with flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) was also monitored. Imidacloprid plus moxidectin (Advocate(\xc2\xae) for Cats, Bayer) and fipronil (Frontline(\xc2\xae) Spot on, Merial) were used as positive control products in the flea and tick studies, respectively. Treatments were administered on Days 0, 30 and 60. Efficacy was calculated based on the mean percent reduction of live parasite counts on post-treatment days 14, 30, 60 and 90 versus the pre-treatment count on Day 0. Non-inferiority of selamectin/sarolaner to the control products was assessed at each time-point using a non-inferiority margin of 15% at the one-sided 0.025 significance level. Cats were enrolled in a 2:1 ratio (selamectin/sarolaner:comparator). In the flea study, 277 cats were assessed for efficacy and safety, and an additional 170 cats were assessed for safety only. On days 14, 30, 60 and 90, efficacy against fleas was 97.4%, 97.3%, 98.8% and 99.4% in the selamectin/sarolaner-treated group and was 90.0%, 83.6%, 87.7% and 96.3% in the imidacloprid/moxidectin-treated group, respectively. Selamectin/sarolaner was non-inferior to imidacloprid/moxidectin at all time-points. For the 16 cats identified as having FAD at enrolment, clinical signs related to FAD improved following treatment administration. In the tick study, 200 cats were assessed for efficacy and safety, and a further 70 cats were assessed for safety only. Four tick species were identified. Overall efficacy against ticks was 96.7%, 92.6%, 98.8% and 99.5% in the selamectin/sarolaner-treated group and was 90.2%, 74.6%, 83.0% and 93.4% in the fipronil-treated group on Days 14, 30, 60 and 90, respectively. Selamectin/sarolaner was non-inferior to fipronil at all time-points, and was superior on Days 30 and 60. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events in any study. Thus, the new spot-on formulation of selamectin plus sarolaner administered at monthly intervals was safe and highly effective against natural infestations of fleas and ticks on cats, and improved clinical signs of FAD.'"

These GWASs not only collect information on the disease status (primary phenotype, D) and the SNPs (genotypes, X), but also collect extensive data on several risk factors and traits. Recent literature and grant proposals point toward a trend in reusing existing large case-control data for exploring genetic associations of some additional traits (secondary phenotypes, Y) collected during the study. These secondary phenotypes may be correlated, and a proper analysis warrants a multivariate approach. Commonly used multivariate methods are not equipped to properly account for the non-random sampling scheme. Current ad hoc practices include analyses without any adjustment, and analyses with D adjusted as a covariate. Our theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the type I error for testing genetic association of secondary traits can be substantial when X as well as Y are associated with D, even when there is no association between X and Y in the underlying (target) population. Whether using D as a covariate helps maintain type I error depends heavily on the disease mechanism and the underlying causal structure (which is often unknown). To avoid grossly incorrect inference, we have proposed proportional odds model adjusted for propensity score (POM-PS). It uses a proportional odds logistic regression of X on Y and adjusts estimated conditional probability of being diseased as a covariate. We demonstrate the validity and advantage of POM-PS, and compare to some existing methods in extensive simulation experiments mimicking plausible scenarios of dependency among Y, X, and D. Finally, we use POM-PS to jointly analyze four adiposity traits using a type 2 diabetes (T2D) case-control sample from the population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study. Only POM-PS analysis of the T2D case-control sample seems to provide valid association signals.'"

The aim of this study was to test this treatment delivered via the Internet in a large-scale randomized controlled trial. We randomized 140 high-worriers (defined as > 56 on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]) to either Internet-based extinction therapy (IbET) or to a waiting-list condition (WL). Results showed that IbET was superior to WL with an overall large between-group effect size of d = 1.39 (95% confidence interval [1.04,1.73]) on the PSWQ. In the IbET group, 58% were classified as responders. The corresponding figure for WL participants was 7%. IbET was also superior to the WL on secondary outcome measures of anxiety, depression, meta-cognitions, cognitive avoidance, and quality of life. Overall treatment results were maintained for the IbET group at 4- and 12-month follow-up.

Those in the treatment condition were offered CBCT for PTSD, a couple-based therapy aimed at reducing PTSD symptoms and improving relationship functioning. PTSD symptoms were assessed at pre-/baseline, mid-/4 weeks of waiting, and posttreatment/12 weeks of waiting using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and patients self-reported on their levels of pretreatment/baseline social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Total support, as well as social support from family and friends, was not associated with initial PTSD severity or treatment response. However, there was a significant positive association between social support from a significant other and initial PTSD severity (g = .92). Additionally, significant other social support moderated treatment outcomes, such that higher initial significant other support was associated with larger decreases in PTSD severity for those in the treatment condition (g = -1.14) but not the waitlist condition (g = -.04). Social support from a significant other may influence PTSD treatment outcomes within couple therapy for PTSD.

The 52 amino acid HIV-1 p6 Gag protein is synthesized as the C-terminal part of the Gag polyprotein Pr55. In this context, p6 promotes virus release by its two late (L-) domains, and facilitates the incorporation of the viral accessory protein Vpr. However, the function of p6 in its mature form, after proteolytic release from Gag, has not been investigated yet. We found that the mature p6 represents the first known viral substrate of the ubiquitously expressed cytosolic metalloendopeptidase insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). IDE is sufficient and required for degradation of p6, and p6 is approximately 100-fold more efficiently degraded by IDE than its eponymous substrate insulin. This observation appears to be specific for HIV-1, as p6 proteins from HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus, as well as the 51 amino acid p9 from equine infectious anaemia virus were insensitive to IDE degradation. The amount of virus-associated p6, as well as the efficiency of release and maturation of progeny viruses does not depend on the presence of IDE in the host cells, as it was shown by CRISPR/Cas9 edited IDE KO cells. However, HIV-1 mutants harboring IDE-insensitive p6 variants exhibit reduced virus replication capacity, a phenomenon that seems to depend on the presence of an X4-tropic Env. Furthermore, competing for IDE by exogenous insulin or inhibiting IDE by the highly specific inhibitor 6bK, also reduced virus replication. This effect could be specifically attributed to IDE since replication of HIV-1 variants coding for an IDE-insensitive p6 were inert towards IDE-inhibition. Our cumulative data support a model in which removal of p6 during viral entry is important for virus replication, at least in the case of X4 tropic HIV-1.'"

Moreover, microbial translocation is associated with insufficient reconstitution of CD4+T cells, and contributes to the pathogenesis of immunologic non-response. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recently showed that, compared to placebo, 12 weeks treatment with probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii significantly reduced plasma levels of bacterial translocation (Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein or LBP) and systemic inflammation (IL-6) in 44 HIV virologically suppressed patients, half of whom (n = 22) had immunologic non-response to antiretroviral therapy (<270 CD4+Tcells/\xce\xbcL despite long-term suppressed viral load). The aim of the present study was to investigate if this beneficial effect of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is due to modified gut microbiome composition, with a decrease of some species associated with higher systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation. In this study, we used 16S rDNA gene amplification and parallel sequencing to analyze the probiotic impact on the composition of the gut microbiome (faecal samples) in these 44 patients randomized to receive oral supplementation with probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks. Compared to the placebo group, in individuals treated with probiotic we observed lower concentrations of some gut species, such as those of the Clostridiaceae family, which were correlated with systemic levels of bacterial translocation and inflammation markers. In a sub-study of these patients, we observed significantly higher parameters of microbial translocation (LBP, soluble CD14) and systemic inflammation in immunologic non-responders than in immunologic responders, which was correlated with a relative abundance of specific gut bacterial groups (Lachnospiraceae genus and Proteobacteria).

METHODS A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter FDA-approved clinical trial was conducted at 30 US centers, comparing the low-profile titanium ceramic composite-based Prestige LP ADR (n = 209) at 2 levels with ACDF (n = 188). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were completed preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at regular postoperative intervals to 84 months. The primary end point was overall success, a composite variable that included key safety and efficacy considerations. RESULTS At 84 months, the Prestige LP ADR demonstrated statistical superiority over fusion for overall success (observed rate 78.6% vs 62.7%; posterior probability of superiority [PPS] = 99.8%), Neck Disability Index success (87.0% vs 75.6%; PPS = 99.3%), and neurological success (91.6% vs 82.1%; PPS = 99.0%). All other study effectiveness measures were at least noninferior for ADR compared with ACDF. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall rate of implant-related or implant/surgical procedure-related adverse events up to 84 months (26.6% and 27.7%, respectively). However, the Prestige LP group had fewer serious (Grade 3 or 4) implant- or implant/surgical procedure-related adverse events (3.2% vs 7.2%, log hazard ratio [LHR] and 95% Bayesian credible interval [95% BCI] -1.19 [-2.29 to -0.15]). Patients in the Prestige LP group also underwent statistically significantly fewer second surgical procedures at the index levels (4.2%) than the fusion group (14.7%) (LHR -1.29 [95% BCI -2.12 to -0.46]). Angular range of motion at superior- and inferior-treated levels on average was maintained in the Prestige LP ADR group to 84 months. CONCLUSIONS The low-profile artificial cervical disc in this study, Prestige LP, implanted at 2 adjacent levels, maintains improved clinical outcomes and segmental motion 84 months after surgery and is a safe and effective alternative to fusion.

Times to onset of antinociception and sedation were significantly shorter with romifidine than with detomidine. The antinociceptive and sedative effects were significantly longer with romifidine than with detomidine. Romifidine or detomidine could be used to provide a reliable, long-lasting and cost-effective method for achieving epidural anaesthesia for standing surgical procedures in buffalo.

However, whether physical activity prevents subsequent sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction would be prevented by prior exercise. We also examined if, in the absence of exercise, standing is an effective alternative strategy to sitting for conserving leg endothelial function. Fifteen young healthy subjects completed three randomized experimental trials: (1) sitting without prior exercise; (2) sitting with prior exercise; and (3) standing without prior exercise. Following baseline popliteal artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measurements, subjects maintained a supine position for 45\xc2\xa0min in the sitting and standing trials, without prior exercise, or performed 45\xc2\xa0min of leg cycling before sitting (i.e. sitting with prior exercise trial). Thereafter, subjects were positioned into a seated or standing position, according to the trial, for 3\xc2\xa0h. Popliteal artery FMD measures were then repeated. Three hours of sitting without prior exercise caused a significant impairment in popliteal artery FMD (baseline: 3.8\xc2\xb10.5%, post-sitting: 1.5\xc2\xb10.5%, P<0.05), which was prevented when sitting was preceded by a bout of cycling exercise (baseline: 3.8\xc2\xb10.5%, post-sitting: 3.6\xc2\xb10.7%, P>0.05). Three hours of standing did not significantly alter popliteal artery FMD (baseline: 4.1\xc2\xb10.4%, post-standing: 4.3\xc2\xb10.4%, P>0.05). In conclusion, prolonged sitting-induced leg endothelial dysfunction can be prevented by prior aerobic exercise. In addition, in the absence of exercise, standing represents an effective substitute to sitting for preserving leg conduit artery endothelial function.'"
