Prefrail and frail persons received home visits from lay volunteers twice a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the physical training and nutritional intervention group (PTN, n = 35) conducted two sets of six strength exercises and received nutritional support. The social support group (SoSu, n = 23) received visits only. TNF-\xce\xb1, IL-6, CRP, and total leukocyte count were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Changes over time within groups were analyzed with paired t-tests; differences between groups were analyzed with ANCOVA for repeated measurements. In the PTN group, IL-6 and CRP remained stable, whereas in the SoSu group, IL-6 increased significantly from a median value of 2.6 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-10.2) to 3.0 pg/l (min-max = 2.0-20.8), and CRP rose from 0.2 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-0.9) to 0.3 mg/dl (min-max = 0.1-3.0) after 12 weeks. In CRP, a significant difference between groups was found. TNF-\xce\xb1 and total leukocyte count did not change in either the PTN group or the SoSu group. Persons showing an increase in physical performance (OR 4.54; 95% CI = 1.33-15.45) were more likely to have constant or decreased IL-6 values than persons who showed no improvement. In conclusion, in non-robust older adults, a physical training and nutritional support program provided by lay volunteers can delay a further increase in some inflammatory parameters.'","[('aged', 'M01.060.116.100.080'), ('aged', 'M01.060.116.100.080'), ('c-reactive protein', 'D12.776.124.486.157'), ('exercise therapy', 'E02.831.535.483'), ('follow-up studies', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'), ('frail elderly', 'M01.060.116.100.540'), ('humans', 'B01.050.150.900.649.801.400.112.400.400'), ('inflammation', 'C23.550.470'), ('interleukin-6', 'D23.529.374.465.224'), ('nutritional support', 'E02.642.500'), ('social support', 'I01.880.853.500.600'), ('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'D23.529.374.750.626')]"

Conservatively treated fingertips can regenerate skin and soft tissues to form a functionally and cosmetically excellent new fingertip. Little is known about this ability that, in humans, is confined to the fingertips. Even less is known about the role of the bacteria that regularly colonize these wounds without negative impact on regeneration and healing.As an alternative to surgery, self-adhesive film dressings are commonly used to establish a wet chamber around the injury. These dressings leak malodorous wound fluid eventually until the wound is dry. Having that into consideration, we have therefore developed a silicone finger cap that forms a mechanically protected, wet chamber around the injury for optimal regeneration conditions. It contains a puncturable reservoir for excess wound fluid, which can be thus routinely analyzed for diagnostic and research purposes.This study protocol explains the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the semiocclusive treatment of fingertip amputations in both children and adults comparing traditional film dressings with the novel silicone finger cap. Being the first RCT using 2 medical devices not yet certified for this indication, it will gather valuable information for the understanding of fingertip regeneration and the design of future definitive studies.'","[('aged', 'M01.060.116.100.080'), ('aged', 'M01.060.116.100.080'), ('c-reactive protein', 'D12.776.124.486.157'), ('exercise therapy', 'E02.831.535.483'), ('follow-up studies', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'), ('frail elderly', 'M01.060.116.100.540'), ('humans', 'B01.050.150.900.649.801.400.112.400.400'), ('inflammation', 'C23.550.470'), ('interleukin-6', 'D23.529.374.465.224'), ('nutritional support', 'E02.642.500'), ('social support', 'I01.880.853.500.600'), ('tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'D23.529.374.750.626')]"

However, no studies concerned recovery after discharge except readmission. This study evaluated an ERAS program for pancreaticoduodenectomy from hospital to home.A prospective ERAS cohort undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy was compared with a retrospective control group in terms of postoperative complications and hospital stay, and home recovery after discharge. Propensity-score matching was used to balance their baselines.Two groups of 31 patients with similar propensity scores were established. Postoperative morbidities were 18 of 31 and 26 of 31 in the ERAS and control groups, respectively (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.06). Patients in the ERAS group suffered from fewer cardiovascular complications (3/31 vs 11/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04) and intestinal dysbacteriosis (4/31 vs 13/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.04). Median postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the ERAS group (8 vs 16 days; P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). Although the 2 groups were similar in terms of sleep, defecation, vigor, performance status, and pain control in first month after discharge, patients in the ERAS group enjoyed better food intake recovery (18/31 vs 5/31 in first week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.002; 22/31 vs 9/31 in second week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.008; 23/31 vs 13/31 in fourth week, P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.01) and fewer weight loss (10/31 vs 19/31; P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a.05).

The team sport training was performed as ~20 min of small-sided ball games twice a week over 12 weeks. After the intervention period, leg muscle mass was 0.6 kg higher (P = 0.047) in TS-HP, with no effect in TS-LP. In TS-HP, number of sit-to-stand repetitions increased (1.2\xc2\xb10.6, P = 0.054), time to perform 2.45 m up-and-go was lower (0.7\xc2\xb10.3 s, P = 0.03) and number of arm curl repetitions increased (3.5\xc2\xb11.2, P = 0.01), whereas in TS-LP only number of repetitions in sit-to-stand was higher (1.6\xc2\xb10.6, P = 0.01).

Focal muscle vibration (MV) is instead very useful to reduce segmental spasticity, with a consequent positive effect on motor function. Therefore, it could be possible to strengthen the effects of robotic rehabilitation by coupling MV. To this end, we designed a pilot randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trial NCT03110718) that included twenty patients suffering from unilateral post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Patients underwent 40 daily sessions of Armeo-Power training (1 hour/session, 5 sessions/week, for 8 weeks) with or without spastic antagonist MV. They were randomized into two groups of 10 individuals, which received (group-A) or not (group-B) MV. The intensity of MV, represented by the peak acceleration (a-peak), was calculated by the formula (2\xcf\x80f)2A, where f is the frequency of MV and A is the amplitude. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), short intracortical inhibition (SICI), and Hmax/Mmax ratio (HMR) were the primary outcomes measured before and after (immediately and 4 weeks later) the end of the treatment. In all patients of group-A, we observed a greater reduction of MAS (p = 0.007, d = 0.6) and HMR (p<0.001, d = 0.7), and a more evident increase of SICI (p<0.001, d = 0.7) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment, as compared to group-B. Likewise, group-A showed a greater function outcome of upper limb (Functional Independence Measure p = 0.1, d = 0.7; Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity p = 0.007, d = 0.4) up to 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. A significant correlation was found between the degree of MAS reduction and SICI increase in the agonist spastic muscles (p = 0.004). Our data show that this combined rehabilitative approach could be a promising option in improving upper limb spasticity and motor function. We could hypothesize that the greater rehabilitative outcome improvement may depend on a reshape of corticospinal plasticity induced by a sort of associative plasticity between Armeo-Power and MV.'","[('abdomen', 'C23.888.821.030.249'), ('aged', 'M01.060.116.100.080'), ('blood pressure determination', 'E01.370.600.100'), ('cardiovascular diseases', 'C14'), ('epinephrine', 'D02.092.311.461'), ('humans', 'B01.050.150.900.649.801.400.112.400.400'), ('hypotension', 'E03.545'), ('intention to treat analysis', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500.500'), ('kidney diseases', 'C13.351.968.419.403'), ('length of stay', 'N02.421.585.400.480'), ('middle aged', 'M01.060.116.630'), ('norepinephrine', 'D02.092.311.461.484'), ('postoperative care', 'N02.421.585.722.700'), ('postoperative complications', 'C23.550.767'), ('precision medicine', 'H02.403.200.700'), ('respiratory tract diseases', 'C08'), ('surgical procedures', 'E04'), ('systemic inflammatory response syndrome', 'C23.550.835.900'), ('vasoconstrictor agents', 'D27.505.954.411.793')]"

Participants were asked to complete a VAS questionnaire (0-100) on the level of difficulty and applicability (user/patient-friendliness) of both techniques. They were asked which technique they preferred and perceived to be more efficient. A quotient of ""effective scan time per software-recorded time"" (TRIOS) was calculated as an objective quality indicator for intraoral optical scanning (IOS). The majority of students perceived IOS as easier than the conventional technique. Most (72%) preferred the digital approach using IOS to take the implant impression to the conventional method (12%) or had no preference (12%). Although total work was similar for males and females, the TRIOS quotient indicated that male students tended to use their time more efficiently.

The study involved a randomized control design and used a convenience sample of all 32 junior-year dental hygiene students enrolled in the autumn 2016 term in The Ohio State University baccalaureate dental hygiene program. Sixteen students were randomly assigned to each of two groups (control and training). At weeks one and four, all participants were photographed and completed ergonomic self-evaluations using the Modified-Dental Operator Posture Assessment Instrument (M-DOPAI). During weeks two and three, participants in the training group were photographed again and used those photographs to complete ergonomic self-assessments. All participants' pre-training and post-training photographs were given ergonomic scores by three raters. Students' self-assessments in the control group and faculty evaluations of the training group showed significant improvement in scores over time (F(1,60)=4.25, p<0.05). In addition, the accuracy of self-assessment significantly improved for students in the training group (F(1,30)=8.29, p<0.01). In this study, dental hygiene students' self-assessments using photographs resulted in improvements in their ergonomic scores and increased accuracy of their ergonomic self-assessments.

In the current pilot study we explored the effects of dietary AGEs on the gut bacterial microbiota composition in similar patients. AGEs play an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular (CVD) disease. Plasma concentrations of different bacterial products have been shown to predict the risk of incident major adverse CVD events independently of traditional CVD risk factors, and experimental animal models indicates a possible role AGEs might have on the gut microbiota population. In this pilot randomized open label controlled trial, twenty PD patients habitually consuming a high AGE diet were recruited and randomized into either continuing the same diet (HAGE, n = 10) or a one-month dietary AGE restriction (LAGE, n = 10). Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after intervention. Variable regions V3-V4 of 16s rDNA were sequenced and taxa was identified on the phyla, genus, and species levels. Dietary AGE restriction resulted in a significant decrease in serum N\xce\xb5-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal-derivatives (MG). At baseline, our total cohort exhibited a lower relative abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes genus and a higher abundance of Prevotella genus when compared to the published data of healthy population. Dietary AGE restriction altered the bacterial gut microbiota with a significant reduction in Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium animalis relative abundance and increased Alistipes indistinctus, Clostridium citroniae, Clostridium hathewayi, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii relative abundance.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thirty minute pulse of blue light versus placebo (amber light) exposure in healthy normally rested individuals in the morning during verbal memory consolidation (i.e., 1.5 hours after memory acquisition) using an abbreviated version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). At delayed recall, individuals who received blue light (n = 12) during the consolidation period showed significantly better long-delay verbal recall than individuals who received amber light exposure (n = 18), while controlling for the effects of general intelligence, depressive symptoms and habitual wake time. These findings extend previous work demonstrating the effect of blue light on brain activation and alertness to further demonstrate its effectiveness at facilitating better memory consolidation and subsequent retention of verbal material.
